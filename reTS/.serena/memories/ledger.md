## 2026-07-08 (cont. 98) — session open: FINISH slow-mo-on-connect (server-side), then queued client fixes

New orchestrator picked up from the cont.97 FINAL START-HERE (HANDOFF.md), branch
`restructure-source-parity`, HEAD `113339e`. Tree = the INTENTIONAL `game/ts/` deletions +
`.serena/project.yml`. Read HANDOFF top-down + `reference/dossiers/cont97/slowmo_connect_bug.md` +
`cont96/client_bloody_and_shards.md`. cont.89-97 orchestrator available for consult via the user.

**Mandate:** (1) FINISH the slow-mo tint/blur-on-connect bug — SERVER-side (user tests the ORIGINAL
client, so `538142a` cl_dll fix doesn't reach them). RE whether the original server force-sends the
slow reset on connect/spawn/StartObserver and MIMIC it. (2) Then the queued client fixes (bloody
blades §A + glass integrator §B).

**State survey (slow-mo, before edits):** `gmsgTSSlowAmt` → wire `"TSSlowMo"` (2, coord) →
client `MsgFunc_TSSlowMo` sets the TARGET `DAT_1009ff04` (client VidInit resets only the CURRENT
`DAT_100963e8`, per dossier). Our send (`player.cpp:4719`) is change-detected on `m_flClientSlowAmt`
(init -1 @player.h:419; reset -1 in `TSInit` @ts_player.cpp:547 = first call in Spawn). **Our
`StartObserver` (player.cpp:1398) resets `fuser1`/`m_flSlowMotionGo`/`m_flSlowMotionTarget`=1.0 but
does NOT reset the `m_flClientSlowAmt` change-detect cache** → the reset-to-100 send is emitted once
in the connect window (MSG_ONE, dropped — the connect-window MSG_ONE drop pattern) and never re-fires
until Spawn re-arms the cache (=why it "resets on spawn"). Working hypothesis to confirm against RE.

**RE (fresh typed Ghidra decompiles this session):**
- **Original UCD @0x91d00 (ghidra):** the ENTIRE TS send body (incl. SlowAmt) is wrapped in a 0.1s
  throttle (`field_0x534`: `if (0<=field_0x534<=time){field_0x534=time+0.1; …}`), **no observer gate**
  → the SlowAmt send runs during spectate too. The SlowAmt block is decompile-exact:
  `fVar1=0.225; if(!(m_iPowerups&8)){fVar1=0.35; if(!(m_iPowerups&1)) fVar1=m_flSlowMotionTarget;}
   if(fVar1!=m_flClientSlowAmt){m_flClientSlowAmt=fVar1; WRITE_COORD(100*fVar1);}` — i.e. slowpause(0x8)
  →0.225, slowmo(0x1)→0.35, else the networked **m_flSlowMotionTarget** (NOT fuser1). Cache holds the
  FACTOR, not ×100.
- **Original StartObserver @0x99634 (ghidra):** resets `iuser4=0; fuser1=1; m_flSlowMotionTarget=1;
  m_flSlowMotionGo=1` — but does NOT reset the m_flClientSlowAmt cache (same as ours). So the original
  relies on the ONE change-detect send landing (it does, on GoldSrc); our ReHLDS rig drops it.
- **Live-read the original client (pid 1295795, client.dll base 0x0c070000):** target `DAT_1009ff04`
  @+0x9ff04 and current `DAT_100963e8` @+0x963e8 both read 1.0 when NOT stuck (confirmed the right
  globals + base; the fresh-process BSS default is the slow value the client eases toward until the
  server lands a reset).

**FIX LANDED (server-side, matches original + defeats the drop):**
1. **player.cpp UCD SlowAmt block rewritten to the decompile-exact original** (was the cont.94
   `pev->fuser1` + invented `m_flSlowMotionRamp` override — a real logic divergence flagged by the LAW):
   slowpause→0.225, slowmo→0.35, else `m_flSlowMotionTarget`; cache the FACTOR; `WRITE_COORD(100*factor)`.
   `m_flSlowMotionRamp` stays live (LOS-victim slowing in ts_player.cpp SlowMotionFlow); player.h:419
   comment updated ("last-sent FACTOR").
2. **player.cpp PreThink one-shot: re-arm `m_flClientSlowAmt = -1`** in the same proven
   post-connect-window `m_flSrvSettResendTime` block (armed for EVERY joiner @TS_gamerulesclass.cpp:1034,
   before the `!g_teamplay` return) that already re-sends SrvSett/TeamRoster → the next UCD re-fires the
   SlowAmt reset at ~+0.75s, past the connect window. Idempotent (UCD change-detects).
Built amd64 hl.so clean (glibc 2.14), deployed to the rig (NOMETAMOD= setup-rehlds-mod.sh), rig
restarted (ts_hammertime, deathmatch, +rcon_password lol).
**PLAYTEST #1 — STILL BROKEN** (my first read was a false positive; the user re-showed the teal tint +
stacked ghost "echoes" of the diving player + no "WAITING" on the scoreboard).

**REAL ROOT CAUSE (gdb-confirmed on the live rig server, NOT guessed):**
- Live-read the ORIGINAL CLIENT while stuck (pid, client.dll base 0x0c070000): slow TARGET `DAT_1009ff04`
  @+0x9ff04 = **0.0** AND current `DAT_100963e8` @+0x963e8 = **0.0** → the client target defaults SLOW
  on a fresh process and NO TSSlowMo reset ever reached it.
- Added SLOWDBG ALERTs to the UCD SlowAmt send + the re-arm; **neither fired** for the human, yet a gdb
  breakpoint on `CBasePlayer::UpdateClientData` (hl.so base + 0xdc770) showed it IS called — but only for
  the 6 BOTS, all with `spec=0`. **No UCD call ever had spec=1** → our UCD does NOT run for a spectating
  player. (First gdb read used the header's *original-binary* provenance offsets = garbage; got the REAL
  compiled offsets from `objdump` of our hl.so — m_flSlowMotionTarget@0x898, m_flSlowMotionGo@0x89c,
  m_flClientSlowAmt@0xbbc, m_iPowerups@0x87c — then re-read: bots all target/cache=1.0, correct.)
- **The bug:** our per-frame `UpdateClientData()` is driven from the END of `CBasePlayer::PreThink`
  (player.cpp:2255, the stock hlu tail), but our reconstruction ADDED an early `if (m_fInSpectateWait)
  {…return;}` block (player.cpp:2026) that returns BEFORE line 2255. So a spectate-waiting player NEVER
  ran UCD → the client's slow TARGET was never reset (stuck slow tint/sound/blur) AND the AWARD/WAITING
  byte was never sent (missing "WAITING"). ONE root cause, BOTH symptoms (the user's "not WAITING" hint
  was the key). Confirmed vs the ORIGINAL: `PreThink` @0x808cc calls `UpdateClientData()` near the TOP
  (line 62) — BEFORE its iuser1 spectate block (line 202, which returns) — so the original runs the whole
  TS UCD send every frame for spectators.

**REAL FIX LANDED (player.cpp):** call `UpdateClientData()` inside the `m_fInSpectateWait` block just
before its `return;` (mirrors the original running UCD for spectators). Kept: the SlowAmt block rewrite
(mirror original: powerup→0.225/0.35 else m_flSlowMotionTarget) + the +0.75s cache re-arm (now EFFECTIVE:
UCD runs during spectate so the re-armed cache re-sends past the connect-window MSG_ONE drop). Removed the
SLOWDBG debug ALERTs. Built clean, deployed, rig restarted.
**VERIFY flagged (deferred):** for full parity the spectate handling should move AFTER
UCD/UpdatePowerUpState/SlowMotionFlow like the original's iuser1 block (spectators should also run
SlowMotionFlow/UpdatePowerUpState). **SLOW-MO USER-CONFIRMED FIXED** (original client, fresh join: no
tint/sound/echoes). ⚠ **BUT the scoreboard "WAITING" is STILL MISSING** — so UCD now runs during spectate
(slow-mo proves it) yet the AWARD/WAITING byte is still not landing. Separate leg of the same UCD path
(gmsgTSPlayerAward, MSG_ALL change-detect on m_iAward): either m_iAward isn't being SET to the WAITING
code (0xb=11 per SetPlayerRespawnTime) for the joiner, or a wire/client-case mismatch. **DIAGNOSED:** same connect-window drop — gmsgTSPlayerAward (MSG_ALL,
change-detect on m_iClientAward @0xeb4/0xeb5 compiled offsets; m_iAward=11=WAITING set by
SetPlayerRespawnTime, confirmed set for teamplay joiners too since mode!=0) sends ONCE during
spectate-wait and is eaten by the joiner's connect window; no re-arm existed. **FIX:** re-arm
`m_iClientAward = 0xff` in the SAME +0.75s one-shot as the SlowAmt re-arm → next UCD re-broadcasts past
the window. Baseline confirmed by the user's ORIGINAL listenserver screenshot (shows "WAITING" in the
team scoreboard). NB the rig IS teamplay (ts/game.cfg `mp_teamplay 1`; +deathmatch on the cmdline is
overridden by game.cfg exec). Built/deployed/restarted. WAITING then USER-CONFIRMED showing.

## 2026-07-08 (cont. 98 cont.) — connect-window drop ROOT CAUSE nailed + FAITHFUL single-send fix (user-confirmed)

The user pushed for true parity ("is this how the original did it?"). Full RE, not guessed:
- **Send sites (RE-verified, unstripped ts_i386.so):** gmsgTSPlayerAward @0x1034b4, gmsgTSSlowAmt @0x103498.
  Each has EXACTLY ONE send site — `UpdateClientData`'s change-detect (award @0x8245d MSG_ALL after
  `cmp m_iAward[0x74c] vs m_iClientAward[0x74d]`; slow @0x822f9 MSG_ONE after `flds m_flSlowMotionTarget
  [0x170]; fcoms m_flClientSlowAmt[0x16c]`). The 0xc8xxx refs are `LinkUserMessages` REG_USER_MSG. We match.
- **Client hook (live gdb on the ORIGINAL client vs a KNOWN-GOOD remote server):** MsgFunc_TSSlowMo @client.dll
  RVA 0x49a00, MsgFunc_TSPAward @0x49a20 (from the HOOK_MESSAGE table `push handler; push "name"`). On
  reconnect the client received BOTH, each ONCE, together (17:53:27.943/.947) and they LANDED → the original
  delivers a SINGLE post-active send to a remote joiner. So it's NOT an unavoidable drop.
- **Server trace (file-write /tmp/slowdbg.log bypassing ALERT/metamod buffering; compiled offsets from
  objdump: slowT@0x898, slowGo@0x89c, slowCache@0xbbc, m_iPowerups@0x87c, m_iAward@0xeb4, m_iClientAward
  @0xeb5, m_fInSpectateWait@0xedc):** the joiner's connect burst (ClientPutInServer→Spawn→RemoveAllItems→UCD,
  ALL at the same frame, BEFORE active) sends slow(1.0)+award(0)+award(11) — **dropped by SV_Multicast's
  `!client->active` gate (sv_main.cpp:958)** because ReHLDS sets `client->active=TRUE` only at the END of the
  spawn handler (sv_main.cpp:1504), AFTER `pfnClientPutInServer` (1436) — but the change-detect still LATCHES
  slowCache=1.0 / awdCache=11. The first post-active PreThink UCD then sees no change → never re-sends →
  perma-slow + no WAITING. `RemoveAllItems` calls UCD in the ORIGINAL too (@0xd8cec line 89), so the game-DLL
  code matches; the delivering difference is the engine's active-timing.
- **⚠ FLAGGED (engine, NOT touched — user: flag don't fix, ask first, notify if 64-bit): NOT a 64-bit bug**
  (the !active gate + ClientPutInServer-before-active are unconditional standard-GoldSrc flow, no pointer/size
  math). Suspected ReHLDS-vs-GoldSrc difference: whether GoldSrc set `client->active` BEFORE ClientPutInServer
  (making the original's identical burst land). Unconfirmed (no GoldSrc source); left for the user to decide.
- **FAITHFUL FIX (replaces the throttled retry — user-confirmed "matches what I see on other servers"):** the
  PreThink spectate block runs ONLY post-active, and reliable msgs retransmit until acked → a ONE-SHOT re-arm
  of the slow/award caches on the first post-active frame makes UCD emit exactly ONE post-active send that
  lands. `m_flSpecResyncTime` armed to <0 in TSEnterSpectate; consumed once in the spectate block. Not a
  throttle. Matches the original's observable single send. All SLOWDBG instrumentation stripped; built clean
  (no SLOWDBG strings), deployed, rig pid 1455254. **Still local, not committed.**

**RE-VERIFIED the send sites (user pushed: "did we RE-verify we send it when/where they do?").** From the
unstripped `ts_i386.so`: gmsgTSPlayerAward @0x1034b4, gmsgTSSlowAmt @0x103498; GOT base 0x165e10 →
award slot ref `0x18cc(%ebx)`, slow `0x1a28(%ebx)`. Each global has EXACTLY TWO refs: one in
`LinkUserMessages__Fv` @0xc7db0 (the `REG_USER_MSG` registration store `gmsg… = REG_USER_MSG(...)`, NOT a
send) and one in `UpdateClientData` (award @0x8245d = MSG_ALL after `cmp m_iAward[0x74c] vs m_iClientAward
[0x74d]`; slow @0x822f9 = MSG_ONE after `flds m_flSlowMotionTarget[0x170]; fcoms m_flClientSlowAmt[0x16c]`).
**CONCLUSION: the original sends each from EXACTLY ONE site — the UCD change-detect — and nowhere else. We
now send from the identical site (same members, same MSG_ALL/MSG_ONE). We are NOT missing a callsite.** So
the re-arm is engine-compensation for the ReHLDS connect-window drop (empirically confirmed cont.96 via a
HW watchpoint on the original client), NOT a faithful-send gap.

**REFINED FIX (replaces the fragile fixed +0.75s one-shot):** a single timed re-fire is a GUESS that fails
if a client's connect window outlasts the delay (high latency / slow load — the user flagged 1000ms). Since
the sole send site is UCD and UCD now runs every spectate frame, re-arm the slow+award change-detect caches
on a 0.25s throttle INSIDE the spectate-wait block (new member `m_flSpecResyncTime`) → UCD re-broadcasts
until the client is past its window. Immediate when it can be, definitive at any latency, self-terminating
on spawn. Removed the one-shot slow/award re-arm from the m_flSrvSettResendTime block (SrvSett resend
itself kept; it has the same latency fragility — FLAGGED for the same treatment later). Built/deployed/
restarted (pid 1340947, teamplay). **PENDING user re-test of the retry version.**
Not yet committed (all local, per the push-only-on-word rule).

**NEXT:** commit on user sign-off; then the queued client fixes (bloody blades §A + glass integrator §B,
`reference/dossiers/cont96/client_bloody_and_shards.md`); then the deferred parity VERIFY above (move the
spectate-wait handling after UCD/UpdatePowerUpState/SlowMotionFlow to match the original iuser1 block).

## 2026-07-08 (cont. 97) — session open: FINISH R1 PHASE 4 (rules-split tail), then queued client fixes

New orchestrator picked up from the cont.96 FINAL START-HERE (HANDOFF.md) at HEAD `520cd92`, branch
`restructure-source-parity`. Tree clean apart from the INTENTIONAL `game/ts/` deletions + `.serena/project.yml`.
Previous orchestrator (cont.89–96) available for consult via the user.

**Mandate:** finish R1 phase 4 (the 11-item list in the START-HERE block; specs in
`reference/dossiers/cont96/r1_rules_split_groundtruth.md`), then the queued client fixes (bloody blades +
glass integrator — `reference/dossiers/cont96/client_bloody_and_shards.md`).

**State survey (before edits):** the two-object split (phases 1-3) is in — `InstallGameRules` @gamerules.cpp:210
news a stock CHalfLifeMultiplay/Teamplay as g_pGameRules and keeps the standalone static `CTSGameRules
s_TSGameRules` reached via `TSGameRules`. Interim deltas found vs the dossier phase-4 target:
- MP::Think calls `TSGameRules->Think()` at the TOP (line 190), original calls it at the END + an
  m_szEndMap GoToIntermission check (§1.2). **Item 1.**
- Teamplay::Think has its OWN body (not chaining to MP except game-over) but NEVER calls TSGameRules->Think()
  and has no IsCTB fraglimit fork — so on team maps the TS round/vote/powerup machine never ticks. The MP::Think
  comment "Teamplay chains to MP" is STALE. **Item 2** (add IsCTB fork + the two-line TS tail).
- `m_szEndMap` already exists as `m_szNextMap[32]` @field_0x1824 (ts_gamerules.h:169); CheckVotes writes it
  (TS_gamerulesclass.cpp:613); Init does NOT clear it; ChangeLevel does NOT consume it. **Item 3.**
- Init call currently in InstallGameRules, not the ctors (§4.4/§4.7). **Item 4.**

**R1 PHASE-4 BEHAVIORAL CORE LANDED — `da0f099` (items 1-8; pending checkpoint-4 playtest).** Each
load-bearing site re-verified by a FRESH typed Ghidra decompile this session before applying (not
trusting the archived /tmp batches): ChangeLevel @0xd0784, ClientDisconnected @0xcf960,
CanPlayerHearPlayer @0xd0ed0, Teamplay::Think @0xe412c, CWorld::KeyValue @0xf4a18.
1. **MP::Think** — TSGameRules->Think() moved from the TOP to the END (after fragsleft/timeleft),
   + `if (m_szEndMap[0]) GoToIntermission()` (@0xbf30a). Only in the !g_fGameOver path.
2. **Teamplay::Think** — added the IsCTB fraglimit fork (reads the TSGameRules 4-team table
   m_teamScore/m_teamNames, the score field is slot+8 = +0x24+i*0x8c) + the two-line TS tail. FIX:
   the TS round/vote/powerup machine NEVER ticked on team maps before (Teamplay::Think had its own
   body but never called TSGameRules->Think(); the MP::Think "chains to MP" comment was stale).
3. **m_szEndMap[0x40]** — renamed from m_szNextMap[32] (@+0x1824); Init clears byte 0; CheckVotes
   writes it (already); MP::ChangeLevel consumes (forced map unless "nextmap"), clears, then
   UNCONDITIONAL TSGameRules->Init() (decompile: Init is OUTSIDE the if-nonempty block).
4. **Init timing** — TSGameRules->Init() moved to the MP ctor (@0xbee05; + the Teamplay ctor's 2nd
   call on team maps = the original double-Init); m_iGameMode = (byte)g_teamplay seeded INSIDE Init
   (@0x67d83); InstallGameRules' explicit Init + m_iGameMode seed retired. Ordering verified safe:
   InstallGameRules runs in CWorld::Precache (world.cpp:528), AFTER worldspawn KeyValue.
5. **MP::ClientDisconnected** — MOVED TSPlayerDisconnect(pl) here from the engine ClientDisconnect
   callback (client.cpp — its original home, after RemoveAllItems) + `m_flNextTheOneSelect = 0`
   (@0xbfacf, +0x587c). Identified +0x587c = m_flNextTheOneSelect via the accessor census (Think
   @0x673f2/@0x674a2, SelectRandomTheOne @0x6af4e/@0x6af70, Init time+10 @0x67eab, disconnect =0).
   Init now arms m_flNextTheOneSelect = time+10 (was 0 → fired immediately).
6. **CanPlayerHearPlayer** — LMS/dead-mode dead-talk isolation: dead talker (!IsAlive [player
   vt+0xb4] && m_flTSRespawnTime<0 [+0x770]) heard only by dead listeners. Gate
   `(byte)(m_iGameMode-2)<2 || g_lastManStanding`.
7. **CWorld::KeyValue "mapteams"** — also TSGameRules->SetTeamList(STRING(pev->team)) (@0xe4cd9),
   guarded (our TSGameRules pointer can be null pre-install on map 1; vestigial, wiped by Init).
   Added `#include "ts_gamerules.h"` to world.cpp.
8. **MP::InitHUD** log model field — already faithful (no change).

**VERIFY resolved:** SrvSett byte-1 cvar = **"usecash"** (confirmed from the binary: the cvar_t at
.data 0x108f10 — C symbol `dmcashbased` — has name field → 0xfcddb "usecash"; "dmcashbased" is only
the SYMBOL name, not a registered cvar). Our `cvar_t dmcashbased = {"usecash",...}` is exact.

**DEFERRED to the item-9 convergence pass (post-checkpoint-4 playtest, per START-HERE item 11 + dossier
§6 apply-order which gates convergence AFTER the playtest):** retire the **6 invented CTSGameRules team
stand-ins** (IsTeamMode, IsTeamplay, GetTeamID, RecountTeams, TeamWithFewestPlayers, GetIndexedTeamName
— audit.py: exactly these 6 remain as INVENTED methods) onto the installed Teamplay virtuals / 0x8c-stride
slot reads; the per-site §4.6 IsTeamMode regrade (15+ sites, each needs its ORIGINAL gate — g_teamplay
vs IsCTB vs dead — do NOT sed to one predicate); SetTeamList's full reconstruction (direct slot tokenize +
The-ONE insertion + "created team %s" ALERT + cap, dropping the invented m_szTeamList/RecountTeams);
and the deeper item-10 VERIFYs needing a live trace/RE (UCD m_fGameHUDInitialized flag ORDER — the cont.96
recursion guard set it BEFORE the InitHUD calls, original sets AFTER §2.1; the Wires HUD m_iGameMode==3
gate which §4.6 says the original NEVER reaches; InitHUD items 9-13 placement). This is a coherent,
risky per-site refactor best done with the checkpoint-4 playtest confirming the foundation first.

**LIVE PLAYTEST (user, original client vs the local rig at 10.23.23.254:27015) — 3 more fixes landed:**

1. **`19309bb` — TDM is FREE-RESPAWN, not round-based.** User: `mp_teamplay 1` said "wait til next
   round" while alive + periodic round restarts. The original Think (@0x67204, tsthink.c 96-121) gates
   the round system STRICTLY by mode: round work only inside `if (g_lastManStanding && m_iGameMode==0)`
   (LMS) or `m_iGameMode>=2` (dead objective modes) — plain DM (0) AND plain teamplay/TDM (1) are
   free-respawn. Our Think used cont.94's over-broad `roundBased = IsTeamMode() || lms`. Replaced with
   the decompile-exact mode gate; dropped the invented Think round-timer arm (RestartRound owns it).
   This IS a §4.6 IsTeamMode regrade (item-9 territory) surfaced by playtest. USER CONFIRMED.

2. **`bdb229b` — teamplay teams/colors were intermittent → periodic team-roster rebroadcast.** The
   connect-window MSG_ONE drop eats the joiner's InitHUD TeamNames/TeamInfo; the +0.75s ResendTeamRoster
   races the client's player-NAME sync. Added a MSG_ALL TeamNames + per-player TeamInfo rebroadcast every
   3s in CHalfLifeTeamplay::Think (INVENTED-INTEROP, same class as cont.96). Stabilized teams/colors but
   NOT the headers (that was a red herring — see #3).

3. **`eb117a6` — THE fix: teamplay HUD/scoreboard all rendered DM-style → rebroadcast gmsgGameMode(1).**
   Deep Ghidra RE of client.dll (via the MCP xref + dc.sh) found the single gate: the client's
   **m_Teamplay flag @0x100cf97c**, set ONLY by MsgFunc_GameMode (FUN_1001fe60→FUN_10021a10 stores the
   msg byte at obj 0x100cf920+0x5c). The scoreboard layout FUN_1005d5f0 branches on it (0 → DM flat
   layout FUN_1005d8f0, team-column count stays 0 → no headers; !=0 → team layout FUN_1005d6a0), and
   EVERY team-HUD element gates on `flag==1`. Our server sent gmsgGameMode(1) only at InitHUD (MSG_ONE,
   dropped in the connect window) and never re-sent it → flag stuck at 0. **Diagnosed by live-reading
   the original client's memory** (/proc/pid/mem, client.dll base 0xc070000): team DATA all present
   (TeamNames count 4, labels team1-4, per-player teams) but flag=0. Folded gmsgGameMode(1) into the #2
   rebroadcast. **USER CONFIRMED** ("yep you did it") — headers + team-name-over-health + green teammate
   dots all came alive; live read shows flag flipped 0→1.

**Live-RE technique proven this session:** read the ORIGINAL client's live memory at
`base(client.dll)+RVA` to inspect its HUD/scoreboard state directly (g_PlayerInfoList, teamname/teamnum
arrays, the scoreboard object at *(base+0xd5cb0), the m_Teamplay flag) — decisive when static RE stalls.
Get client.dll RVAs via the HOOK_MESSAGE registration (push handler; push name; call) + dc.sh. Also:
**objdump misses computed stores** (`*(obj+0x5c)=x` never shows as a write to the absolute addr) — the
Ghidra MCP xref (or following the dispatch) is required. The connect-window MSG_ONE drop (cont.96) is a
RECURRING root cause — anything sent once at InitHUD as MSG_ONE to the joiner needs a rebroadcast.

**Also `b480098` — fixed stale `tm_avana` map refs** (CLAUDE.md §3, setup-*.sh, HANDOFF launch examples):
that map does NOT exist in TS; real maps are `ts_*` + `ctb_deadheat`. mp_teamplay on a DM map like
`ts_hammertime` is an INTENTIONAL config (how the original dev ran them), NOT degenerate.

**R1 ITEM-9 CONVERGENCE DONE — `21ff210` (audit.py INVENTED methods 9→4; behaviour-preserving, live-verified).**
Retired 5 of the 6 invented CTSGameRules quintet stand-ins:
- **GetTeamID, TeamWithFewestPlayers** — dead, deleted.
- **IsTeamMode, IsTeamplay** — deleted; the original's gate is the global `g_teamplay != 0` (== m_iGameMode>=1;
  2/3 dead §4.6). All 13 internal + 6 external callers (TS_entities/ts_worldgun/ts_buy) read g_teamplay now.
- **RecountTeams + m_szTeamList** — deleted; SetTeamList reconstructed per §4.5 (direct slot tokenize + dedup +
  The-ONE insertion + "created team %s" ALERT + cap g_theOneMode?2:4). RestartRound no longer re-tokenizes.
- **KEPT: GetIndexedTeamName** — thin name-by-index slot accessor, ~8 callers; the original inlines the slot
  read but removing it = 8 duplicated bounds-checks for an INTERNAL helper (not the external-interface target);
  documented + accepted. Other 3 audit-invented (TSEnterSpectate/LoadActiveFromItem/SyncActiveToItem) are
  separate helpers, out of quintet scope.
Verified via LIVE client-memory read after the convergence: m_Teamplay=1, TeamNames count 4, labels team1-4,
per-player teams intact — the new SetTeamList produces the same roster. Builds clean; check-source-lists agrees.

**Convergence scare = the DM-boot transient, NOT the refactor (reverted then re-applied `690f156`→`03ec435`).**
The "spectators-only / empty roster" after the convergence deploy was the SAME thing that happens on ANY fresh
restart: the rig boots in DEATHMATCH because `mp_teamplay` defaults to 0 (not in server.cfg; `+mp_teamplay` on
the command line doesn't stick — resets before the game dll registers cvars), so the FIRST InstallGameRules
installs CHalfLifeMultiplay (no roster). rcon `mp_teamplay 1` sets the cvar but the loaded map keeps its DM
rules object; only a `changelevel` re-runs InstallGameRules with teamplay=1 → CHalfLifeTeamplay → roster built.
**FIX (rig-local test convenience): `~/Containers/hlds/.../ts/game.cfg` = `mp_teamplay 1`** — InstallGameRules
does `exec game.cfg` right before DecideGamePlay, so it sticks from the first map (no changelevel). NOT a mod
change / not in the repo (a real server sets teamplay per-map). The reconstruction was always correct.

**`6e7ce98` — team NAMES lagged colors ~1s on join → fixed.** gmsgGameMode(1) (the m_Teamplay gate) was only in
the 3s periodic rebroadcast, so the roster arrived at +0.75s (ResendTeamRoster) but names sat un-rendered until
the next 3s tick (colors came fast via frag ScoreInfo). Folded gmsgGameMode(1) into ResendTeamRoster too. Note:
the value is a CONSTANT 1 (the game-mode enum: 0=DM/1=teamplay, per class, mirrors CHalfLifeTeamplay::UpdateGameMode),
NOT mp_teamplay.value and NOT m_iGameMode(0-3) — the client only understands 0/1.

**`1378b79` — TEAMPLAY HAD ROUNDS (regression the user hit: "wait til next round" on death + "DEAD" flashing on
LIVE players after a round restart). Root: `InitObjectives` (TS_gamerulesclass.cpp) INVENTED an
`if (g_teamplay) m_iGameMode = 2/3` promotion → promoted plain teamplay (mode 1) into the DEAD objective mode 2
→ the Think round gate ran the round machinery. The original NEVER promotes 1→2/3 here — entry gate
`if ((byte)(mode-2) > 1) return;` (only re-flips 2↔3 when ALREADY 2/3, never reached). Restored the entry gate;
teamplay stays mode 1 = free-respawn regular TDM. HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE (RE): the mode is decided ONCE at map
load by DecideGamePlay — mp_teamplay→mode 1 (free respawn), lastmanstanding→mode 0+g_lastManStanding (rounds,
individual LMS), objective modes 2/3 (rounds, DEAD/never reached). There is NO "round TDM" in the shipped game.
USER-DRIVEN discovery — this is the InitObjectives §4.6 VERIFY that was flagged "still open" and IS the culprit.

**`538142a` — slow-mo tint + motion-blur "shadows" persist on reconnect (CLIENT, our cl_dll only — see caveat).**
Reset `g_flClientSlow` (+ m_flSlowAmt) in `CHudTSPowerUp::VidInit` (cl_dll/ts_powerup_hud.cpp) to match the
original `CHud::VidInit` (@0x100206c0) resetting the slow CURRENT (DAT_100963e8=1.0) on connect. Our current is
only eased in Draw (doesn't run while spectating) → stale <1 drove the view.cpp tint + ts_motionblur ghost
spawner (both gate on the slow current). ⚠ **CAVEAT: the USER TESTS THE ORIGINAL CLIENT (hl.exe), so this
cl_dll fix does NOT reach them — their tint is SERVER-side and STILL OPEN. See
`reference/dossiers/cont97/slowmo_connect_bug.md` for the full RE + next steps.**

**SLOW-MO-ON-CONNECT — IN PROGRESS / UNFINISHED (server-side, original-client bug).** RE'd this session:
original `SlowMotionFlow` @0x86bb0 slows LOS-visible players with NO spectator gate (⇒ slowing spectators IS
original; my spectator-skip guess was WRONG and reverted — `dlls/ts_player.cpp` SlowMotionFlow now matches the
original). Client `CHud::VidInit` resets the slow CURRENT but NOT the TARGET (DAT_1009ff04, message-driven). The
"no players" reconnect tint ⇒ our SERVER isn't pushing a `TSSlowMo`(normal) reset on connect to clear the
client's stale target (send is change-detected @player.cpp:4719 on m_flClientSlowAmt). **NEXT: RE whether UCD
runs for spectators + whether the ORIGINAL server force-sends the slow reset on connect/spawn/StartObserver;
find + mimic that mechanism (don't invent). Full dossier: cont97/slowmo_connect_bug.md.**

**XASH CLIENT TEAMPLAY SCOREBOARD — CONFIRMED FINE (user).** No cl_dll work needed: `vgui_ScorePanel.cpp` (the
VGUI TeamFortress ScorePanel — SortTeams winner-on-top, team headers, spectators section, TS "WAITING" class-11
status) already renders teamplay correctly once the server feeds the data (m_Teamplay + roster). The client RE
this session (FUN_1005d5f0 layout / FUN_1005da20 rebuild / MsgFunc_GameMode·TeamNames·TeamInfo·ScoreInfo /
the scoreboard object at *(client.dll base+0xd5cb0)) is the reference if the Xash look ever needs matching.

**STILL OPEN:** re-grade the remaining §4.6 IsTeamMode-turned-g_teamplay sites if any need IsCTB/lms specifically
(the round-gate site was already fixed `19309bb`; others are behaviour-preserving g_teamplay reads); the powerup
Think gate (`if (g_teamplay) skip` — original gives dynamic powerups in mode<2 i.e. teamplay too — a // VERIFY
regrade); the InitObjectives mode-2/3 promotion (dead-path fidelity §4.6). Then the queued client fixes (bloody
blades + glass integrator, client_bloody_and_shards.md). DM "Spectate-as-team" was stale client state (not a bug).

New orchestrator picked up from the cont.95 START-HERE (HANDOFF.md) at HEAD `336b501`, branch
`restructure-source-parity`. Tree clean apart from the INTENTIONAL `game/ts/` deletions. Previous
orchestrator (cont.89–95) available for consult via the user.

**Session plan (from the cont.95 open list + dossier `reference/dossiers/cont95/README.md`):**
1. **Knife auto-pickup + arsenal corruption (#4a)** — static RE contradicts the observed auto-grab
   (type-25 CTSWorldGun WaitTouch needs TSW_FLAG or IN_USE; ours is byte-identical to @0xa1250).
   Needs a LIVE SERVER TRACE on the rig: gdb break on CTSWorldGun::WaitTouch / GetWeapon /
   CBasePlayer::PickUpWeapon while the user runs over a death-dropped knife; then fix the
   half-pickup (stackable-knife PickUpWeapon not registering m_items/WStatus).
2. **Melee knockback/disarm (#4b)** — RE CloseCombatAttack @0x85f88 (>30-dmg knockback gate,
   |attacker vel|·dir, z=235) for grounded living victims; RE m_flDisarmPressure (player+0x7b4)
   / DropWeapon(-2) accumulation on kicks/punches.
3. **Buy-menu root-cause finish (#2)** — one no-workaround build + client watchpoint
   (recipe preserved in the cont.95 dossier) to decide whether the 0.75s re-broadcast stays.
4. Standing: audit.py/coverage.py parity sweep; R1 CTSGameRules split (own session); push after
   user sign-off (ALL mod-ts + ReHLDS quic/64bit commits still LOCAL).

**#1 knife auto-pickup — RESOLVED at HEAD (user-confirmed, no code change).** Live gdb trace on the
rig (`reference/dossiers/cont96/decompiles/knife_trace.gdb` — non-stop logging breakpoints on
CreateWeapon/WaitTouch/Use/GetWeapon/PickUpWeapon/TakeWeapon, RelWithDebInfo hl.so): death-dropped
knife confirmed CTSWorldGun type 25 clip=1 (TSDropWeaponsOnDeath→DropWeapon→ThrowWeapon); **23 bot
run-overs + the user's own run-over all REFUSED by the WaitTouch gate** (button=0x0, zero GetWeapon
calls); E-pickup path correct (Use needs IN_USE, cooldown blocks the dropper, carried clip restored).
User re-tested with the ORIGINAL client: no auto-grab, deliberate E-pickup registers + fires normally.
Likely the cont.95 symptoms were partly the WStatus melee-clip encoding bug fixed in `2e8ebf2`
(kung-fu/melee cell red = clip<1). Reopen only if it recurs — the trace recipe names the path.

**#3 buy-menu ROOT CAUSE — CLOSED: InitHUD's MSG_ONE SrvSett IS dropped at connect; the 0.75s
re-broadcast (ce04557) is LOAD-BEARING, kept.** Method: built with the workaround disabled (`0 &&`),
armed the hardware watchpoint on the original client's restriction global (base 0x0c070000 unchanged,
target 0x0c1fd174, poisoned 0x6f6f6f6f), user reconnected → **ZERO writes through the whole join +
spectate + buy-menu open**. Positive control: rcon `weaponrestriction 1`/`0` fired WRITE #1 = 0 and
WRITE #2 = 0x1f instantly at the known handler (caller 0xc0bb8bc = RVA 0x4b8bc) — watchpoint, wire and
handler all proven good, so the connect-time send genuinely never arrives. NB the poisoned global made
the menu RENDER as unrestricted during the test (0x6f6f6f6f has the category bits set) — the menu look
was the poison, not a landed message; the real-world symptom needs a fresh client (global defaults 0).
Workaround comment in player.cpp PreThink upgraded to CONFIRMED/load-bearing; `0 &&` reverted; Release
rebuilt + redeployed + rig restarted. **Wine-gdb recipe fix preserved:** batch gdb attached to hl.exe
dies on Wine's SIGUSR1 — `handle SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2/SIG33/SIG34 nostop noprint pass` required
(`reference/dossiers/cont96/decompiles/client_watchpoint_v2.gdb`).

**#2 melee knockback/disarm — `7c7788c` the RUN-THROUGH attack reconstructed (pending playtest).**
RE dossier (read-only agent, user-resumed): `reference/dossiers/cont96/melee_knockback_disarm.md`.
The find: our direct-hit CloseCombatAttack @0x85f88 was ALREADY byte-faithful (gate `bKnockback &&
flDamage>30` on RAW pre-multiplier damage; velocity += |attacker vel|·dir, z=235 hard-set; grounded
living victims included) — the bug was the original's SECOND melee channel, the whiff/run-through:
a missed swing arms player+0x79c/0x7a0/0x7a4 (window / ±flat dmg 35/45/55 / type) and
CheckForBreakables @0x8bd9c (per PreThink tick) makes the attacker's moving hull the weapon —
Victim*Hold deflect, spawn-protect-gated DropWeapon(-2) disarm, the same >30 knockback at full
sprint speed, per-type sound, TraceAttack halving per hit. We had (a) the WRONG two values stored on
a whiff (whiffT into the window, scaled ≤30 into the force → knockback could never fire), (b) the
whole player branch of CheckForBreakables deferred, (c) a DUPLICATE recon (TSCheckRunThrough,
ts_gun.cpp) of the same original function — DELETED (it also broke the one-hit-per-victim dedupe by
NULLing m_hRunThroughLast when grounded), (d) invented CTSStunt::m_pLastBreakVictim — removed.
Verified myself before applying: the 3 (only) 235.0f sites, the @0x76d02-0x76d50 store slots, and
the flat-vs-scaled // VERIFY settled by 3 agreeing reads (Ghidra dataflow, cont.93's slot note in
our own comment, >30 semantics) — playtest step 2 discriminates regardless. GUNS have NO knockback
in the original (TakeDamage ×2 re-verified velocity-free; ColdCock passes bKnockback=false) — only
the death launch (DamageForce). Disarm: kicks DO disarm (thr 30/25/clamp(slotCost,20,50) vs
accumulated pressure, ×5/s decay) — core was already faithful; the run-through was its only missing
feeder. Both libs build; rig + xash redeployed. Playtest protocol: dossier §5.6.

**#1 (reopened + TRULY closed) — `40fab88`: the "knife pickup corruption" is the BRIEFCASE
(TSW_FLAG=29).** The corruption cluster (kung-fu red + knife viewmodel + empty-click) came BACK
after the melee commit; trace v2 (`cont96/decompiles/knife2.gdb`, +SelectWeapon/WStatus/EMPTY-CLICK
state) caught the truth: the grabbed object is weapon slot 29 — the briefcase (map ts_groundweapon
on hammertime / CTF flag), `PickUpWeapon(29, NULL, bSelect=0)`. 29 = 0x1d = the WaitTouch
auto-pickup gate value (that's what the gate is FOR) + bare-handed grabs auto-wield — both
faithful. It LOOKS like a knife because the ORIGINAL's Write_flag @0x64804 gives the held
briefcase v_knife/p_knife/w_knife.mdl (keep — wire contract; loose flag = briefcase.mdl,
separate + faithful). OUR bug: PrimaryAttack had no fire-type-11 branch → briefcase fire fell
into the standard-gun path (one phantom bullet, clip 1→0, then 398 logged dry-clicks). Original
@0x71ac2: firetype 11 → fresh-press gate (player+0x814&1) → altMode=0 → KnifeFire slash
(secondary already faithfully no-ops @0x717e6). Implemented + deployed. Retro-solves cont.95 #4a
("death-dropped knife" = a briefcase in the corpse pile — the static RE was right). Followups in
the cont96 dossier: the @0x758c8 melee-bar byte for firetype 11; items[29] lifecycle on DropFlag.
Pending user confirm (briefcase slash + no red/empty-click).

**Kill-feed weapon names — `5f6940d` (user-reported: "tsgun" everywhere, 'knife'/'grenade' raw).**
(a) 18 weapon-table szName entries were NULLPTR (extraction gap) → the cont.93 pszName fix fell
back to "tsgun". All recovered from the binaries (Write_* decompiles + the client.dll mirror
table); ak47/aug/ump are EMPTY in the ORIGINAL (zeroed .rodata @0x106600 — mimic, don't invent);
"Kung-fu" exact case @0xf843c. (b) DeathNotice name chain rewritten decompile-exact to PlayerKilled
@0x795e4: glast_weaponid first (tracked slow-bullet — name what FIRED), → "Kung Fu" → "<gun> Stock"
→ active table name; classname=="knife" → CTSKnife::GetDescription ("Throwing Combat Knife"/"…Seal
Knife"/"…Katana" @0x6db04); targetname-before-classname for non-clients; tail remaps 'knife'→
"Throwing Knife", 'shrapnel'→"Shrapnel", 'grenade'→"M61 Grenade" (@0x10c734 = "handgrenade"+4);
log line lowercase+underscore transform; stock egon/gauss rename dropped. (c) glast_weaponid reset
MOVED to UpdateBullet right after ApplyMultiDamage (@0x5f311) — was in PlayerKilled, stale on
non-kill hits → misattributed later kills. PARKED for R1: name computed in PlayerKilled + the
4-arg DeathNotice (T2Pc) signature + kill-streak log flavor ("stopped_fury"/"is_unstoppable"
@0x89e0d block). Both libs build; deployed. Pending user playtest.

**Bloody blade blinks clean at idle — `dc118b0` (user-reported).** The bloody katana/knife is a
viewmodel SUBMODEL (body 1). Server side verified faithful (KatanaFire/KnifeFire set it.bloody +
pev->body; WeaponIdle @0x754dc passes this->pev->body; vuser2.x ships it.bloody — cont.89/90 map).
Our gap: the hit branch is #ifndef CLIENT_DLL and the client restore re-seeded it.bloody but NOT
the predicted gun's fake pev->body → the predicted WeaponIdle (3s timer — the "couple seconds")
re-sent the idle anim with body 0 → clean blink until the next swing event. Fix: HUD_WeaponsPostThink
seeds g_TSGun.pev->body from the restored bloody for blades. RE note: the original CLIENT also
keeps a per-swing bloody global (DAT_10189e08, katana handler @0x44230: stores iparam2, forces 1 on
texture 'F' flesh) — refs are handler-local (swing anim body), matching our ev_ts.cpp handlers.
OPEN: user to confirm WHICH client showed the blink — if the ORIGINAL client (not xash), there is a
further seam (what feeds ITS predicted idle body vs our server) still to RE.

**OPEN: xash client "Press Fire To Play" sometimes never spawns (sticky per session).** Analysis:
fire-to-play = the CLIENT sends `respawn` (TS_SpectateFireCheck, cl_dll/ts_spectate.cpp:83) gated on
`in_attack.state & 1` AND `!m_TSBuyMenu.IsUp()`; CHudSpectate::Draw always runs while g_iUser1!=0.
Sticky-per-session candidates: (a) buy menu logically up (eats fire by design), (b) cursor-state
desync (clicks go to VGUI, +attack never sets — PRIME suspect), (c) server respawn gate. User
discriminator asked: menu visible? cursor free? does console `respawn` spawn? native vs browser
xash (browser has the known pointer-lock issue).

**`a5cc737` two CLIENT fixes (user screenshot pair proved client-side):** (1) glass shards pooled
at the pane base on OUR client — velocity formulas were RE-correct all along; the bug was GRAVITY:
the original shard system (@client 0x47cb0) uses 0.05 (tempent+0x38), we passed FTENT_GRAVITY
(full g) → now a FTENT_CLIENTCUSTOM 40 u/s² integrator. (2) xash "Press Fire To Play" eaten after
CHANGELEVEL: buy-menu m_active survived the level change invisibly; TS_SpectateFireCheck's IsUp()
gate ate every fire click → CHudTSBuyMenu::VidInit now Close()s ([[map-change-state-reset]]).
**STILL OPEN — katana bloody blink on the ORIGINAL client (dc118b0 fixed only ours):** RE state:
original client's fake pev->body = FUN_10007110(type, attachMask) = ATTACHMENT submodel sum (no
bloody!); its weaponanim replay (HUD_WeaponsPostThink @0x3830 line~183) sends that body (or 2 for
non-tsgun). CheckForBreakables dir=g_vecZero VERIFIED faithful (GOT 0x167698). Next lead: how the
ORIGINAL server keeps its client's idle bloody — maybe the ORIGINAL sends the katana attach bit /
or the idle anim choice differs; live-compare vs the original server (user has it) or RE the
original client's SendWeaponAnim wrapper.

**Glass shards CLIENT-side (v2-v7, final `8acde7b` — user: "very close to original").** All in
cl_dll/ts_debris.cpp only (wire untouched — no drop-in risk). Journey: formulas were RE-correct;
the motion was wrong. Facts learned: xash delegates tempent physics to OUR HUD_TempEntUpdate
(entity.cpp — pfnTempEntUpdate), xash alloc defaults bounceFactor=1 (elastic "bouncy balls" —
now 0.2), and the ORIGINAL's custom shard integrator (@0x47cb0 alloc FUN_1004ffe0 / commit
FUN_10050b60) works in PER-FRAME units + time-scaled gravity (slow-mo = moon-grav). Final approx:
velocities x10, FTENT_GRAVITY full-g, bounceFactor 0.2. VERIFY: exact-match RE of the original
integrator remains queued.

**`86f6fe8` "Press Fire To Play" dead after changelevel — FIXED, user-confirmed.** Live gdb on the
running xash client proved the CLIENT innocent (in_attack.state=4 clicks registered; g_iUser1=3
spectating; respawn WAS being sent). The SERVER refused: m_flTSRespawnTime stores an ABSOLUTE map
time; the clock resets at changelevel, so the wait equaled the previous map's whole uptime
(TSEnterSpectate deliberately keeps a future deadline). Fix: ClientPutInServer clears it (fresh map
clock). Also `269ca64`: the run-through window is the SHORT whiffT (0.1-0.35s) — the dossier's
scaled-10-30 reading made a whiffed melee a ~30s landmine (user-caught: auto-hit on approach).
NOTE for xash live-gdb: ptrace_scope needed 0 (Proton sets a ptracer allowance, xash doesn't).

**R1 (USER MANDATE: do first) — phases 1+2 LANDED (`b827dea`, `23cbb04`); ground truth `753bc10`.**
Phase 1 (Y8/Y9): PlayerKilled + PlayerSpawn overrides dissolved to their original homes (scatter →
CBasePlayer::Killed @0x7ed5c; TheOneIsDead+CallCheckDeads → TS-patched MP::PlayerKilled @0x795e4;
kill-time DropFlag deleted (StartObserver owns it — flag drops ~3s later, faithful); equip core →
MP::PlayerSpawn @0x790ac (stock crowbar/9mm path GONE); initial_cash → ClientPutInServer @0xacf44,
once per connect). USER CONFIRMED checkpoint 1 (kill/spawn/cash all fine).
Phase 2: **CTSGameRules is STANDALONE** (base:null, no vtable — every override now a plain method);
g_pGameRules = stock TS-patched CHalfLifeTeamplay (team) / CHalfLifeMultiplay (DM); static object +
ctor/Init split; disasm-proven wires: MP::Think → TSGameRules->Think() (@0xbf302; Teamplay chains),
UCD InitHUD block → TSGameRules->InitHUD() (@0x81dfa). motd → public SendMOTDToClient (VERIFY
original path). Both libs build; source lists agree; server boots + bots play.
**Ground-truth dossier (r1_rules_split_groundtruth.md) — phase 3 drivers:** (a) ⚠ modes 2/3 are DEAD
in the original (InitObjectives' 2/3 promotion unreachable; DecideGamePlay returns ONLY 0/1;
worldspawn `gamemode` 1-4 = DM/TDM/LMS/TheOne) → the IsTeamMode>=2 interim is REFUTED; live gates:
mode==1 / g_teamplay / IsCTB = mode==1 && ts_briefcase (cached +0x5890/91). ⚠ OUR Wires HUD gates on
m_iGameMode==3 — the original never reaches 3 → re-RE the wires gate. (b) TSGameRules.Init called
from the MP+Teamplay CTORS + ChangeLevel (not InstallGameRules — ours calls it there, near-identical
order; align in phase 3). (c) TSGameRules+0x1824 = m_szEndMap[0x40] vote buffer (CheckVotes writes →
Think checks → GoToIntermission; ChangeLevel consumes + Init). (d) ~13 in-place stock patches census
(MP ctor/Think✓/InitHUD-log/ClientDisconnected/ChangeLevel; Teamplay ctor/Think✓/SetDefaultPlayerTeam
/ChangePlayerTeam/CUIC/RecountTeams; CanPlayerHearPlayer LMS dead-talk; CWorld::KeyValue gamemode/
mapteams/teammodels). (e) Full CTSGameRules::InitHUD 15-statement dissolution table + the TS-patched
Teamplay pair typed bodies — ready to apply. PLAYTEST CHECKPOINT 2 pending (DM loop + a team map).

**R1 phase 3 LANDED (`72a6761`)** — the TS-patched CHalfLifeTeamplay (ctor/SetDefaultPlayerTeam/
ChangePlayerTeam/CUIC/RecountTeams-CTB-tail per dossier §3, all decompile-anchored);
CTSGameRules::AssignToTeam DELETED (jointeam → ChangePlayerTeam per @0x9e4b0; Y9-4 interim gone);
CTSGameRules::InitHUD dissolved per §2.5 (cheats/damagemult notices added, SrvSett byte-0 = Think
cache, TeamNames/TeamInfo roster now the stock Teamplay::InitHUD's); worldspawn gamemode/teammodels
keys added. Shims tagged: pev->team stamp in ChangePlayerTeam (objectives gate — VERIFY original
CanInteract source). Rig restarted with +teamplay 1. CHECKPOINT 3 = the team experience (ally dot,
Tab teams, team VGUI, jointeam→spectate→5s, team models, FF). Phase-4 remainder: MP ctor Init call
+ ClientDisconnected/ChangeLevel patches + m_szEndMap vote machinery + CanPlayerHearPlayer LMS +
quintet retirement tail (IsTeamplay/GetTeamID/RecountTeams/TeamWithFewestPlayers members on
CTSGameRules still standing, callers to converge) + the dmcashbased/usecash naming VERIFY + the
Wires mode==3 divergence re-RE. Client dossier fixes (bloody SVC_WEAPONANIM skiplocal + glass exact
integrator) QUEUED behind R1 per user mandate.

**R1 CHECKPOINT 3 (team experience) — PASSED after 4 fixes (`8b31b93`..`+scoreinfo`), all user-confirmed:**
(1) InitHUD recursion crash (Teamplay::InitHUD→ChangePlayerTeam→StartObserver re-armed m_fInitHUD →
stack overflow; guard set before the InitHUD calls — VERIFY original UCD flag order). (2) IsTeamMode
was the old lazy objective-manager proxy — cached 0 at ctor time (no entities) and silently disabled
the ENTIRE team layer; now the mode gate (m_iGameMode>=1) per the ground-truth dossier. (3) dead
players flapped to "Spectate": stock StartObserver sent TeamInfo("") — the original sends
TeamInfo(TeamID()) @0x89922 (disasm-verified) so the dead KEEP their team. (4) team names/colors
blank until a kill: the ORIGINAL client's scoreboard section name/color AND individual player color
key off the ScoreInfo TEAMID column + TeamInfo — all the join-time catch-ups are MSG_ONEs in the
connect drop window; CHalfLifeTeamplay::ResendTeamRoster (INVENTED-INTEROP, rides the 0.75s SrvSett
resend) resends TeamNames + per-player TeamInfo + per-player ScoreInfo(teamid). ALSO: mp_teamplay is
the cvar (not `teamplay`); +cvar on the command line doesn't stick for game-dll cvars — set via rcon
+ changelevel. OPEN from checkpoint 3: xash client scoreboard has NO team sections (cl_dll
reconstruction item — needs the original client Tab renderer RE); the DM empty-team-box/"Spectate"
cosmetics on the original client (queued client RE); "created team %s" ALERT missing in our
SetTeamList (cosmetic).

**SESSION END (cont.96 FINAL).** R1 phase 4 was IN PROGRESS when the session ended — the specs are
all read + pinned (r1_rules_split_groundtruth.md §1.2-§1.4/§5.1): Think call POSITION (ours is at
the TOP of MP::Think, original = END + m_szEndMap check), Teamplay::Think reshape (own body + IsCTB
fraglimit fork), m_szEndMap[0x40] vote/ChangeLevel machinery, MP ctor Init, MP::ClientDisconnected
patch (move TSPlayerDisconnect from client.cpp + FireTargets game_playerleave + +0x587c clear),
CanPlayerHearPlayer LMS dead-talk, CWorld mapteams→SetTeamList call, InitHUD-log cosmetic, quintet
convergence tail, the flagged VERIFYs (UCD flag order / dmcashbased / InitHUD items 9-13 homes /
the Wires mode==3 divergence). Full numbered list + the queue (bloody blades, glass integrator,
xash scoreboard sections, DM team-box) in the HANDOFF cont.96 FINAL block. Trace kits preserved in
reference/dossiers/cont96/decompiles/. ALL LOCAL through f27a7d6 — push on user sign-off.

*(Entry updated as work lands — see below for cont.95's blow-by-blow.)*

## 2026-07-07 (cont. 95) — INTEROP playtest (original client vs our ReHLDS): 3 latent bugs + the FindEntityByString crash

User playtested the ORIGINAL TS client against our ReHLDS server (the true drop-in test) and surfaced
THREE latent bugs (all predate this session; masked because our own client shared the same flaws). All
RE-grounded, all fixed, 2 of 3 user-CONFIRMED in-engine.

- **`2e8ebf2` crouch-jump insta-kill + kung-fu bar red.** (a) `TSCheckRunThrough` (ts_gun.cpp, @0x9bd9c)
  dealt RAW velocity (200-350) as damage to AIRBORNE players → any crouch-jump into someone = instant
  kill. It's a DUPLICATE reconstruction of `CTSStunt::CheckForBreakables`, whose sister correctly EXCLUDES
  players (the faithful player-barge is the gated close-combat run-through, NOT this raw dmg=speed
  TraceAttack). Fix = exclude players here too (VERIFY the original's exact player branch). (b) WStatus
  melee bar sent clip 0 for kung-fu (TSW_MELEE); the original client reds any cell with clip<1. Kung-fu
  has NO clip → send -1 (WEAPON_NOCLIP → byte 255) so it renders normal. **kung-fu red CONFIRMED fixed;
  insta-kill NOT yet user-confirmed.**
- **`ce04557` buy menu empty at join (SrvSett delivery WORKAROUND).** The buy menu showed only kevlar (a
  Player Accessory, not a weapon CATEGORY) — all 5 weapon categories appeared restricted. **Our ENCODING
  is CORRECT** (0x1f=all, 0x1=knives, 0x3=knives+pistols — user verified live; IsRestrictedWeapon @0x770c8
  matches). Root: the client's restriction global (client.dll DAT_1018d174) defaults to 0 (=nothing
  allowed = empty), and our InitHUD MSG_ONE SrvSett catch-up fires during the spawn sequence, which the
  original client DROPS. A later send lands (proven: the on-change command MSG_ALL updates a connected
  client fine). We replicate ALL THREE original SrvSett senders (Think on-change @0x675f6, InitHUD
  catch-up @0x691e0, cmd @0xb595f), register at ServerActivate, defer InitHUD via m_fInitHUD — STRUCTURALLY
  IDENTICAL to the original. So it's a client-side RECEPTION issue at connect. **WORKAROUND (marked
  invented in code):** a one-shot re-broadcast of the 4 SrvSett settings ~0.75s after connect
  (CBasePlayer::PreThink honours m_flSrvSettResendTime, set in InitHUD), landing during spectate-wait
  before the menu opens. **CONFIRMED fixed** by the user. ⚠ TODO ROOT-CAUSE: watchpoint on the CLIENT's
  DAT_1018d174 (client.dll + 0x18d174, the ONLY writer @0x1004b8b7) during a join to see why our InitHUD
  MSG_ONE is dropped — then remove the workaround.
- **weaponrestriction + bots = FAITHFUL, NOT a bug.** User: bots spawn with weapons under weaponrestriction 1.
  RE-confirmed: weaponrestriction restricts ONLY the BUY path (our BuyWeapon checks IsRestrictedWeapon;
  the original PickUpWeapon @0x83318 has NO restriction check). Real players are correctly gated (user
  verified). Bots bypass because rcbot direct-gives weapons (or grabs map weapons) — never through
  BuyWeapon. Restricting pickups would be a DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE (the original has none) — only do it if
  the user explicitly wants it. (Did NOT verify rcbot-give vs map-pickup as the exact source.)

- **ReHLDS `FindEntityByString` crash FIXED (the long-open bot-crash task).** Caught live under gdb TWICE:
  `__strcmp_avx2 ← PF_find_Shared ← FindEntityByString ← rcbot_mm_amd64.so`, scanning
  "info_player_deathmatch" on bot respawn. **64-bit-specific:** string_t is a 32-bit offset from pr_strings;
  the rcbot amd64 plugin computes MAKE_STRING as a raw pointer diff from its OWN memory → out-of-pool
  offset written to an edict field → PF_find_Shared resolves pr_strings+garbage → SIGSEGV. Added a 6-line
  bounds guard (skip offsets outside the Ed_StrPool hunk) — the READ-side counterpart of the write-side
  truncation SV_SpawnServer already guards on 64-bit. Committed ReHLDS `quic` (`a8d6c8d`) + cherry-picked
  to `64bit` (`411c42b`). Server survived ~25min bot combat where it died twice in ~2min before.

**ALL mod-ts commits LOCAL/unpushed** (user pushes after full playtest). This session's fixes sit on top of
cont.94's 32-commit autonomous clear-out (baseline was 04a6a23; now at ce04557).

**OPEN / NEXT:**
1. ✅ crouch-jump insta-kill fix (2e8ebf2) — user CONFIRMED fixed. (all 3 interop fixes now confirmed.)
2. Buy-menu ROOT CAUSE — **watchpoint DONE (client.dll+0x18d174 = live 0x0c1fd174 in hl.exe; the ONLY
   writer, the SrvSett handler @RVA 0x4b8bc, DID fire).** Proven: our SrvSett REACHES + APPLIES on the
   original client; the applied value tracks m_iWeaponRestriction exactly (wrote 0 when weaponrestriction 1,
   0x1f when weaponrestriction 0). gdb suppresses same-value writes, so I could NOT tell if InitHUD's early
   send or the 0.75s re-broadcast is the one that lands. TO FINISH: build with the workaround DISABLED
   (comment out the m_flSrvSettResendTime block in player.cpp PreThink + the InitHUD set), reconnect, watch
   — if 0x1f still lands, InitHUD works and the workaround can be removed; if empty, InitHUD is dropped and
   the workaround is load-bearing (keep it). Watchpoint recipe: hl.exe PID (was 22494, CHANGES), client.dll
   base = first r-xp mapping (was 0x0c070000), target = base + 0x18d174; `set *(int*)ADDR=0x6f6f6f6f` poison
   then `watch`. Scripts in scratchpad/w4.gdb.
3. weaponrestriction + bots = FAITHFUL (user accepted). No action.
4. **NEW GAMEPLAY BUGS from interop playtest (NOT yet fixed — need a fresh session):**
   a. **Death-dropped knife auto-picks-up on run-over (should need E) + CORRUPTS the arsenal.** User ran
      over another player's death-dropped knife (no E) → it auto-grabbed. Symptoms = HALF-PICKUP: the knife
      viewmodel deploys (m_weaponType=knife) but it's NOT in the WStatus weapon bar (m_items[knife].owned
      wrong), firing gives EMPTY-CLICK, and the kung-fu bar cell goes RED. STATIC RE CONTRADICTS the
      behavior: a death-dropped knife = CTSWorldGun type 25 (TSW_KNIFE); every WaitTouch (CTSWorldGun @257,
      CTSGroundWeapon @544) gates auto-pickup on type 0x1d (TSW_FLAG=29) || (button & IN_USE 0x20) — BOTH
      our WaitTouch AND the original's @0xa1250 are identical/faithful. ThrowWeapon always makes a
      CTSWorldGun (no knife special-case). CTSKnife::WaitTouch (thrown-knife) only damps velocity, no
      pickup. So a type-25 knife auto-grabbing is UNEXPECTED per the static code → **NEEDS A LIVE SERVER
      TRACE**: break on the running rig's CTSWorldGun::WaitTouch / GetWeapon / PickUpWeapon when the user
      runs over the knife, to see the ACTUAL path + why it fires without IN_USE, then fix the half-pickup
      (PickUpWeapon of a stackable knife not registering m_items/WStatus). File: dlls/ts_worldgun.cpp
      (WaitTouch/Use/GetWeapon), dlls/ts_gun.cpp (PickUpWeapon/TakeWeapon for stackables).
   b. **Melee knockback wrong.** Kicks/punches should send the victim FLYING BACK; currently they only fly
      back on death (or mid-air), and it "doesn't match the original." RE the melee knockback: CloseCombatAttack
      @0x85f88 has the >30-dmg knockback (|attacker vel|·dir, z=235) — check why it's not firing for grounded
      living victims (the >30 gate? the flDamage passed? faithful vel source?). Also user wants punches to
      possibly DISARM (knock weapons out of hands) — RE whether melee disarm (DropWeapon(-2), the
      m_flDisarmPressure / player+0x7b4 accumulator) applies to kicks/punches vs only the melee twins.
5. The cont.94 deferred structural set (R1 CTSGameRules standalone-class split, etc. — see cont.94 entry).
6. Push everything after the user is satisfied (all mod-ts commits + ReHLDS quic/64bit still LOCAL).

**CONTEXT NOTE:** this session ended at ~70% context. Items 2(finish)/4/5 are fresh-session work. The knife
bug (4a) specifically needs a LIVE gdb trace on the rig, not more static reading.

## 2026-07-07 (cont. 94) — TraceAttack full parity; client-display cvars RE'd; parity sweep regenerated; goldsrc.net web-join fixes

New orchestrator session from the cont.93 START-HERE. Baseline `04a6a23`. Ran the cont.93 subagent pattern:
3 parallel read-only RE-dossier agents (dossiers in `reference/dossiers/cont94/`), then sequential apply.

- **`4b7c421` TraceAttack FULL parity (RE @0x801cc; dossier `traceattack_followups.md`).** The two cont.93
  VERIFYs resolved: (a) player+0x524 is NOT a direct member — it decomposes to CTSStunt+0x34 = our EXISTING
  `m_flBulletTimeEnd` (only writer GoBulletTime = time+0.55, the standing matrix-dodge — the "roll-dodge"
  framing was wrong); added the TraceAttack read: BULLET taken in the window ×0.7, stacks with iuser4 ×0.7.
  (b) player+0x71c is the SPAWN-PROTECTION deadline — renamed m_flDisarmTime→m_flSpawnProtectTime (one
  member, four consumers, our writer already exact); added the TraceAttack first-statement no-damage gate
  @0x801eb + DefaultDeploy's push-out @0x902f0. Plus the line-by-line diff fixes D3–D13: friendly-fire
  early return; corpse BulletDance + airborne drift; feedback (msg+sounds) moved INSIDE the 0.3s throttle;
  hit-sound mask BULLET|BLAST (not CLUB); headshot.wav/headshot2.wav only (headshot1.wav doesn't exist —
  removed its failing precache); one bArmoredHit flag drives kevlarhit + the +128 wire bit; sound params
  1.0/1.25/95+rand31; pain2/3/4 voice (3/7) added; dmgreport alert; REMOVED the invented TakeDamage Pain()
  call + m_flNextPainTime (original Pain @0xc847c has ZERO call sites — dead code kept for symbol parity).
  FLAGGED not done: D14 the TS 8-arg EMIT_SOUND_DYN overload (trailing slow-mo pitch-floor float; 0.5 body /
  0.15 pain) — repo-wide separate item; SpawnBlood/TraceBleed kept TODO-invented until the client TSTakeDamage
  handler exists. Both libs build. Playtest protocol in the dossier §end.
- **Client-display cvars RE complete (dossier `client_display_cvars.md`).** All 10 registration defaults
  already matched the ORIGINAL binary (cl_thirdtransparency IS "1" — the .scr's 0 is GUI-only; do NOT
  change). Exact gates recovered: cl_thirdtransparency (@0x678e6, (int)!=0 with the aim flag),
  cl_showequipment (passive weapon-bar alpha ×0.25/×0.5/×1/hide), cl_solidcross (0 additive cross_e /
  >0 solid cross2, >1 BLACK), cl_thirdpersonswitch (==1.0 exact, WeaponInfo handler toggles), cl_fx
  muzzle-smoke gate, cl_laser=style + cl_lasercolor=announce-only (ALL render color incl. local comes from
  the server-echoed byte). DEFERRED (consumers un-reconstructed): cl_gore (PTakeDam blood multiplier table),
  cl_motionblur (TSMBlur ghost trails), cl_wavedetail (realbullet trails). Apply-agent ran after this entry.
- **Parity sweep regenerated at HEAD (dossier `parity_sweep.md`).** Headline: external contract close
  (0 wire-size mismatches/64 msgs, 12/12 events, 0 missing server cmds, 0 cvar-default mismatches, binary
  factories 0 missing). Real gaps: 7 client message hooks (TSMBlur/NextStunt/TSPSys/TSFlag/Objective/
  ShowObj/TSHVoice), 11 missing client cvars (gl_fog×6, cl_drawnames, cl_thirdperson, m_accel×3),
  specmode/special mechanism swap (original registers them CLIENT-side), HUD_DirectorEvent export rename,
  ~23 invented methods to fold (CTSGameRules ×11, CTSGun ×7, CBasePlayer ×5), 6 invented globals, and one
  small MISSING: CTSGun::Holster @0x75674 (forwarder to HolsterWeapon — best small close). Known-false
  metrics documented in the dossier (RECONSTRUCTION_COVERAGE's TS_RE filter artifact).
- **goldsrc.net web-join debugging (user live-testing, separate repos):** (1) "login required" while
  logged in — the rejection is ReHLDS webauth failing CLOSED; the LOCAL rig had no GAME_SERVER_SECRET and
  the ticket check ignored sv_lan. Fixed ReHLDS (sv_main.cpp): the WT ticket requirement now applies only
  when sv_lan==0 (LAN admits web clients at SteamID 0 like any LAN client); rebuilt build-quic-amd64 +
  hot-swapped the rig engine (wrapper respawned it). Cloud path unverified — if the user was joining the
  cloud server, need DevTools /api/game-token status + box logs. (2) React /play harness kept the engine
  ALIVE after route-away (audio + SDL key handlers ate the login form) — XashGame.tsx now forces a full
  reload on unmount when the route left /play (StrictMode-safe); user added a hover top-bar with a plain
  <a> exit link. tsc clean.

**Later in the session:** `7faa1e6` the cvar apply landed (reviewed, both libs build); `829fae4`
CTSGun::Holster override (@0x75674 forwarder — we fell through to STOCK Holster) + HUD_DirectorEvent
export rename (HUD_DirectorMessage kept as the xash by-name alias, documented ours-only); `44b964a`
dropped the ViewMode/SpecFade/ResetFade client hooks (HL leftovers; viewport methods kept for the
spectator code's internal calls); `37b0491` coverage regen + dossiers committed. A further RE agent was
dispatched for the 7 missing client message hooks + cl_gore blood tail + specmode/special mechanism
(dossier `client_message_hooks.md` when done). HANDOFF cont.94 START-HERE written.

**Final round:** `739a599` the client_message_hooks RE dossier + `6f7b147` its FULL implementation —
the 7 dark hooks are live (TSMBlur ghosts via TentEntAllocCustom w/ the exact curstate contract;
NextStunt red dive-arc + the server sender UNPARKED; TSPSys wind handler w/ deferred consumer seam;
TSFlag/Objective/ShowObj/TSHVoice as ONE CHudTSObjectives element mirroring the original CHudTS;
PTakeDam blood spray w/ the cl_gore table — the invented CalcDamageDirection call removed;
specmode/special swapped to the original mechanism: client-side HLTV command + cl_drawnames, server
accept-branches removed). New files ts_motionblur.cpp/.h + ts_objectives.cpp/.h, all four source lists
synced. Both libs build; rig + xash roots redeployed (rig respawned on the new build). ALSO resolved
outside this session (parent CLAUDE.md 2026-07-08): the CLOUD web-join bugs — a stale prod schema 500'd
the ticket burn, and map-change reconnects re-demanded the burned ticket (fixed: SteamID reuse on
reconnect). With the rig sv_lan fix + the /play teardown fix, the whole login saga is closed.

**NEXT:** the parity-sweep remainder (invented-method folds, invented
globals, tsbuy*/HL-leftover command strip, sk_* strip w/ gSkillData caution, 11 missing client cvars);
D14 EMIT_SOUND_DYN overload; user playtest (traceattack dossier §end protocol); cloud web-join datapoint;
the still-blocked items (bot-crash gdb repro, doors-glass, floating-weapons probe, push).

## 2026-07-07 (cont. 93) — Interactive playtest round 2: damage model, kill feed, death drop, globalslow

User back at the keyboard reporting more playtest issues; RE-grounded fixes (commits `45c8253..2ff251c`).

- **`70da4a4` TraceAttack hitgroup multipliers — THE damage fix.** Our `CBasePlayer::TraceAttack` used
  STOCK gSkillData (head ×3, torso mults, leg ×1). The original TS `TraceAttack` @0x901cc is fully custom:
  **HEAD ×2 bullets-only** (mask 0x8000002; ×1.5 for 0x2000000/shotgun; **MELEE headshot = NO bonus**),
  **LEGS ×0.5**, **chest/stomach/arms ×1** (no torso multiplier), + a ×0.7 slow-mo/stunt damping
  (iuser4 & 0x10c10). This was BOTH complaints: "2-shot beretta" (head ×3 + torso inflation) and the
  jump-kick "insta-kill" (a melee hit to the head got the ×3 bullet-headshot mult). Sets glast_headshot on
  a real headshot. VERIFY/todo: the roll-dodge i-frame ×0.7 (player+0x524) + the early-return gate
  (time < player+0x71c) not yet modeled; the TraceAttack presentation (gmsgTSTakeDamage report, kevlar/
  hit/pain sounds) is a separate pass.
- **`45c8253` jump auto-kick (CloseAttack @0x8c630) trigger gates.** Added two MISSING gates (m_flRollTime>0;
  iuser4 & 0x30c30 mid-stunt) and FIXED the kung-fu gate: the original blocks only when NO weapon item is
  active (m_weaponType==TSW_MELEE), NOT on empty grip — so knives/katana (empty grip, real weapon) CAN
  jump-kick (ours wrongly blocked them). No KungFu powerup needed (only ×2 damage). Base kick dmg
  clamp(speed×K,10,20)×2 = ≤40 confirmed faithful (the insta-kill was the TraceAttack mult above).
- **`54449de` kill feed shows the real weapon**, not "tsgun". DeathNotice used m_pActiveItem->pszName()
  ("tsgun"); the original PlayerKilled @0x795e4 names the ACTIVE type via get_weapon_info(m_weaponType)->
  pszName (s_weapon_info+0x44, "Beretta 92F"). Added the tsgun special-case.
- **`380ad35` death weapon-scatter: akimbo drops TWO guns.** TSDropWeaponsOnDeath bypassed
  CBasePlayer::DropWeapon (TSThrowWorldGun once/type) → akimbo dropped ONE gun. Original Killed @0x7ed5c
  loops DropWeapon(type,0) over all types + a 2nd when iAkimboType!=-1; our DropWeapon @0x84900 already does
  akimbo→two-singles + no-ops unowned, so routing through it scatters two. ("something off in the drop".)
- **`2ff251c` `globalslow` command (Permanent Slow-motion) — the cvar audit's one real server gap.** It's a
  COMMAND (not a cvar) we never registered (→ "Unknown command"), AND its per-frame Think driver was ALSO
  missing. Added both: cmd_globalslow @0xb5580 (percent→0..2 scale, 100%=off) + AddServerCommand, and the
  RE-exact first block of Think @0x67204 (expire/restore/maintain via GlobalSlowMotion2).
- **`257758b`/`8d837c2` etc. (cont.92 continued):** kSil PDW silenced model; the 3rd-person transparency
  feature.

**CVAR/SETTINGS AUDIT** (`reference/dossiers/cont91/cvar_settings_audit.md`): 39 TS cvars. Server 17/20 honored;
the user's 3 priorities (initial_cash / weaponrestriction / realbullet-Low) all FINE. **FOLLOW-ON (client.dll
RE):** 9 registered-but-unread client-display cvars — notably **cl_thirdtransparency should GATE the
3rd-person transparency feature** (it's currently always-on; the .scr default is OFF), and we read
`cl_lasercolor` where the .scr uses `cl_laser`.

**BOT CRASH (#3) — RETRACTED my "reproduced on ts_hammertime" claim:** the server restart + minidumps I saw
were the USER'S REBOOT (plasmashell crash), invisible to me. The FindEntityByString/ts_hammertime crash is
UNCONFIRMED; /tmp/dumps minidumps are untrusted (reboot artifacts). The WaitThink brace fix (`9566cd5`) stands
(binary-proven, independent). NEEDS a real repro on a stable machine, under a PROPERLY-ATTACHED gdb (the
`hlds_run -debug` wrapper does NOT attach gdb — run hlds_linux directly under gdb).

**STILL OPEN:** doors-glass playtest; floating-weapon runtime probe (both need the user); the broad audit/
coverage sweep; the cl_thirdtransparency gate + the other 8 client-display cvars.

## 2026-07-07 (cont. 92) — AUTONOMOUS bug-sweep from a playtest report (RE-grounded, subagent-orchestrated)

User ran a playtest (original TS client vs our ReHLDS server), reported a batch of bugs, then stepped away
asking me to work the whole list autonomously (no client playtests available → verification = RE-correctness +
clean builds; playtest confirmation flagged PENDING). Orchestrated read-only RE-dossier subagents + focused
edit-agents; dossiers in `reference/dossiers/cont91/`. Commits `2e4d678..8d837c2`. Started at `c817041`.

- **`2e4d678` bullet-whizz radius.** Confirmed the near-miss "whizz" IS original (client.dll references
  `weapons/whizz%d.wav` in FUN_100450c0; plays on OTHERS' bullets, shooter!=local, within a perpendicular
  near-miss). Ours was faithful except the radius — guessed 56, RE'd `_DAT_1007cccc`@0x1007cccc = **75.0**.
- **`6c83a7d` melee/damage vs players (4 sub-bugs, all RE-verified).** (a) Shooting a MIDAIR player launched
  them — combat.cpp had re-added the STOCK HLSDK `pev->velocity += vecDir*-DamageForce()` push; the original
  `CBaseMonster::TakeDamage` @0xa2430 has **NO** such push (verified: 270-line decompile, no DamageForce call /
  no velocity write; DamageForce is only the death launch). Removed. (b) kung-fu fling = that push double-dipping
  on melee (CloseCombatAttack @0x85f88 already applies its own faithful attacker-speed pop) — fixed by (a).
  (c) crouch-kick instakill: CCombatAttack @0x76078 passed the speed/melee/KungFu-scaled `lunge` as flDamage;
  original passes the FLAT `reach` (35/45/55), scaling only the whiff-lunge store — pass `reach`. (d) jump
  auto-kick registered on players with a flesh sound + no anim: the hit tail's `m_flNextAttack` re-arm was
  `if(<=0)=0.5` (never true) so a queued gun attack fired right after the kick; RE-exact tail (re-arm
  `<WeaponTimeBase()`→+0.35, CHAN_BODY pitched closecombat.wav, UpdateMeleeBar(dmgBase*1.5)). The user's
  "jump-kick is breakables/doors-only" theory was FALSE (CloseAttack @0x8c630 has bPlayersOnly=0).
- **`7c75c76` + `9566cd5` dropped weapon (CTSWorldGun "WorldGun", from DropWeapon@0x84900).** Endless friction:
  BounceTouch@0xa0b0c damps horiz on EVERY ground contact (<=40→×0.7, else→×0.9, same k on velocity+avelocity);
  ours lacked the else branch and set avelocity=velocity → throws (speed 60-180) never damped → slid forever
  (+ skated off edges into the void = the steep-drop-sink / near-edge-vanish reports, all downstream). Near-edge
  pickup: ObjectCaps@0xa3404 = FCAP_CONTINUOUS_USE (0x10); ours returned FCAP_IMPULSE_USE (0x8). **Coupled bug
  (`9566cd5`, binary-proven, from the crash review):** `WaitThink` had lost its braces so `UTIL_Remove(this)`
  ran UNCONDITIONALLY every tick (orig @0x9104c gates both under `m_flExpire<time` — `jae` skips both) → dropped
  guns vanished ~0.1s after settling (masked before by the friction bug never letting them settle).
- **`257758b` kSil[] PDW.** Added the missing silenced PDW held model `{19,"models/p_pdw_sil.mdl"}` (string
  confirmed in both binaries). — This is the ONLY concrete fix for the "floating held weapons" report; the RE
  proved the per-weapon held-model DATA is faithful (pszPlayerModel byte-matches @0x6fe28; p_usas/p_beretta
  byte-identical bones; player.mdl has aim_/idle_ for every grip). **Float root-caused, NOT fixed:** it's the
  REMOTE player's `pev->sequence`==0 (bind pose) — a runtime CTSAnimation body-pose issue; needs a runtime probe
  (dump remote pev->sequence + m_szAnimExtention per weapon) + user confirm. Do NOT touch pszPlayerModel/pev->body.
- **`8d837c2` 3rd-person self-transparency (client feat).** Ported client.dll V_CalcNormalRefdef @0x678b8: in
  3rd person, fade the local model toward alpha 100 (rendermode kRenderTransColor) while the crosshair aim-trace
  is on a player, ease to 255 otherwise; spectator/dead opaque-reset. Was missing from our cl_dll (original client
  has it). `cl_dll/ts_reticle.cpp` (aim classifier g_iTSAimTarget) + `cl_dll/view.cpp`.

**Bot crash (#3):** the WaitThink brace bug (`9566cd5`) is the leading suspect — rapid create→settle→free WorldGun
edict churn under bot combat feeds rcbot's cached pickup pointers → FindEntityByString UAF on a freed+reused slot.
HIGH confidence it's a real bug, MEDIUM it's precisely that crash. Could NOT reproduce autonomously (45min bot
combat + rcon map-churn across 5 maps, debug.log empty; bots idle without waypoints on some maps). Fixed server
redeployed + boots clean with bots. If it persists post-fix, remaining suspect is rcbot's own cache invalidation.

**VERIFY / PENDING (all need the user's playtest — none confirmed in-engine this session):** every fix above;
the melee CloseAttack fire-gate (fireType==0x10 vs bare-hands, `// VERIFY`); the transparency ease steps 50/5 +
the __ftol sub-gate; the WorldGun slow-mo threshold 40*GiveSlowMul(). **STILL OPEN (not user-mentioned this
batch):** the floating-weapon runtime probe; doors.cpp breakable-glass playtest (cont.90); the broad audit.py/
coverage.py parity sweep; the flagged cd+0x1b0 drift (orig UpdateClientData sends player+0x724=m_iPowerups on
vuser1.y, we send m_flMeleeBar — VERIFY).

## 2026-07-07 (cont. 91) — DROP-IN pump shotgun: rack alternation + shell-by-shell reload (live active-item bytes on the wire)

Original TS client vs OUR ReHLDS server. Two shotgun bugs, both a clientdata mis-pack found by decompiling
the **original server's** `UpdateClientData` free function (`UpdateClientData__FPC7edict_siP12clientdata_s`
@nm **0xa0294** — the cont.89 note's "0xb0294" was a typo). The active-weapon (id 0x10) branch packs the
**LIVE active-item bytes** (`pItem = *(gun+0xcc)`), and we were shipping the wrong fragmented halves on two
slots:
- **vuser4.x (cd+0x1d0) = `*(byte*)(pItem+0x24)`** — the pump fire/**RACK toggle** (akimbo barrel otherwise).
  We sent `it.altMode` (always 0 for a pump gun) → the original client's `ShotgunFire` never entered the rack
  half → **fired every trigger pull** instead of fire→pump→fire→pump.
- **vuser2.x (cd+0x1b8) = `*(int*)(pItem+0x8)`** — the pump/shell **RELOAD phase** (burst counter / grenade
  cook / bloody-blade share the byte). We sent `it.bloody` (0 for a shotgun) → the client never saw the phase
  → **no shell-by-shell reload** (open→insert→close never predicted).

**Root cause = field fragmentation.** The original reuses ONE byte per weapon family (item+0x24 = pump toggle
*or* akimbo barrel; item+0x8 = reload/burst phase *or* bloody), but our reconstruction split each into separate
members (`m_fInSpecialReload`/`it.altMode`; `m_burstOrPhase`/`it.bloody`) and the wire shipped the wrong one.

**Fix** (`dlls/client.cpp` server pack + symmetric `cl_dll/hl/hl_weapons.cpp` client read + write-back — both
directions): send/read the LIVE byte, branching by `awi->iFireType` — PUMP → `m_fInSpecialReload` on vuser4.x;
KNIFE/KATANA → `it.bloody` on vuser2.x, else the gun's `m_burstOrPhase`. Akimbo (vuser4.x=altMode) and blade
(vuser2.x=bloody) paths unchanged; normal firing unchanged (both fields 0 when idle). Both libs build clean
(GLIBC_2.14, `scripts/build.sh amd64 all`).

**VERIFIED — user playtest, original TS client → our ReHLDS server (`ts_kissmeyerbasic`):** pump shotguns now
alternate fire→pump→fire, and reload is shell-by-shell. Both fixed.

**Adjacent gap flagged (not yet fixed — VERIFY next):** the original `UpdateClientData` writes
**cd+0x1b0 (vuser1.y) = player+0x724 (m_iPowerups)**, but we send `m_flMeleeBar` there — a possible separate
drift on the melee-bar / powerup channel. Also still open from the handoff: FindEntityByString metamod/rcbot
bot crash; doors.cpp breakable-glass path unplaytested; cont.89/90/91 commits unpushed.

## 2026-07-07 (cont. 90) — DROP-IN bug-driven parity: weapon prediction fronts + breakable-glass shatter (live RE)

Continued the cont.89 drop-in mandate (our server ⇄ original hl.exe/client.dll) by fixing the bugs
the last playtest surfaced, each RE-grounded (decompile + live gdb trace on the running original) and
verified in-engine (original hl.exe client vs our ReHLDS server). All fixes in SHARED code so both
directions move together.

**Weapon-state prediction — 4 gaps in the clientdata weapon pack (`7ca23bf`, `CTSGun::UpdateClientData`
@0xb0294):**
1. **holdPosition on cd->vuser2.z (item+0x2c)** — the sideways/upright weapon-hold stance. The original
   client reconciles it (HUD_WeaponsPostThink, cd+0x1c0→activeItem+0x2c); unpacked → the original client's
   stance floated and the orientation blinked. Now packed + read back.
2. **paired-variant clip on cd->ammo_shells (cd+0x6c)** — the PARKED akimbo/single variant's clip
   (m_items[iAkimboType|iSingleType].clip) so the client shows/predicts the parked cell. We were sending
   buckshot ammo there → parked bar cell rendered -1/red. **Corrects the cont.89 dossier mislabel of cd+0x6c
   as "queued weaponanim".** Now packed + read back.
3. **kung-fu bar cell red** — WStatus clamped the melee clip (-1, WEAPON_NOCLIP) to 0, which the original
   client reds (clip<1). The original writes it RAW (-1 → byte 255 → not red). Send raw; keep change-detect
   distinct from not-owned.
4. **orientation resets on switch** — Deploy@0x81030 CLEARS m_pActiveItem->holdPosition every deploy; we
   restored the parked value → a sideways-parked weapon redeployed sideways + blinked. Cleared in
   LoadActiveFromItem (shared).
   Plus **single→akimbo clip mirror**: StandardFire@0x824a4 mirrors a single's shot into its parked akimbo
   (akimbo.clip--, akimbo.leftClip = single.clip, clamp ≥0). We only had the reverse (AkimboFire→single),
   so draining the single left the parked akimbo stuck at N/N.

**Akimbo uzi deploy flicker (`a7651cd`):** single LEFT-hand uzi shown ~1s before the akimbo idle. Root:
`s_drawSeq[16]=2`, but in v_uzi_akimbo.mdl seq 2 = "left_idle" (one-uzi idle), not the draw — the akimbo
draw is seq **4 "akimbo_draw"**. Recovery error unique to the uzi (2 is the SINGLE uzi's draw index,
wrongly reused). Verified every other akimbo viewmodel's draw index correct (mk23=5, beretta=2, gold=2,
fnh=1, skorpion=1). This closes the cont.89 "STILL OPEN: uzi deploy body flicker".

**Breakable-glass shatter (`48c32e1`, gmsgTSCreateDebris "TSFrags" — CBreakable::Die@0x752e0 /
TraceAttack@0xc1060 / client FUN_10047cb0):** the sprite-shower diverged in FIVE ways, all found by
decompile + live-tracing the original server:
- **Wire field order was wrong.** Correct msg = [origin][size][material][impact POINT][DIRECTION]
  [bitsDamageType(**LONG**)][velMag]. We sent [direction][centre] + a **SHORT** model index — the SHORT
  under-sent 2 bytes so the client's READ_LONG ate the velMag bytes → velMag read 0 → static/slow shards.
- **The LONG is bitsDamageType, NOT a sprite index.** Client resolves sprites/glassfrag.spr by NAME; uses
  the LONG only to pick the velocity formula. Server stores the killing hit's dmgType in TraceAttack
  (m_iShatterDmgType +0x114) and Die sends it.
- **Two velocity branches keyed on (dmgType & 0x8000002):** DMG_BULLET(0x2) → SCATTER (RANDOM(-9,9)/axis +
  a 1/dist directional bias → majority forward, some back/down); else → tight forward cluster
  RANDOM(dir·velMag·0.5, dir·velMag+15). We only had the cluster → bullets looked like the knife shatter.
- **Direction/point are the exact killing hit's** (m_vecShatterDir +0x104, m_vecShatterPoint +0xf8, stored
  in TraceAttack), not the stale global g_vecAttackDir.
- **velMag = the killing shot's damage** (glass local_474=1), **×8 when bit 0x2000000 set** (was a 150·dmg
  guess ~10× too fast; traced ~16-21 for a ranged bullet). The ×8 bit = ShootBulletsPlayer's iMode==1 =
  weapon_info+0x20 (our iKnifeType); **every SHOTGUN sets it** (benellim3/mossberg/sawedoff/spas12/usas12) —
  a shotgun blast propels glass. We had the iMode==1 code but the shotguns' field defaulted to 0.
- **doors.cpp breakable-glass path fixed the same way** (still UNPLAYTESTED — see NEXT).

**Verified:** both libs build clean (glibc 2.14, `scripts/build.sh amd64 all`); in-engine original hl.exe
client vs our ReHLDS server (bullets scatter, knives cluster, shotguns propel).
**NEXT / VERIFY:** (1) **FindEntityByString crash with metamod/rcbot bots** — TS-specific (rcbot fine on
valve), likely a use-after-free of a UTIL_Remove'd TS entity still being iterated; run the rig with metamod
under the gdb wrapper to catch the faulting caller. (2) **doors.cpp breakable-glass path is unplaytested.**
(3) cont.89+cont.90 commits are UNPUSHED (local `restructure-source-parity` ahead of origin). Then resume the
broad audit.py/coverage.py parity sweep.

## 2026-07-06 (cont. 89) — DROP-IN both directions: movement + weapon-state + reload prediction, fire cadence, akimbo cluster

The whole cont.89 session was **drop-in compatibility** — our server must behave identically to the
original for the ORIGINAL TS Steam client (`hl.exe`/`client.dll`), and our client for the original server.
The user keeps the original TS running under Proton for live gdb traces. Every fix landed in the SHARED
code (dlls/ + cl_dll/) so BOTH directions move together. Dossiers in `reference/dossiers/cont89/`.

**Movement prediction (dossier `movement_prediction.md`):**
- `4ae0b1e`/`5f45f09` **PM_Accelerate accel-by-speed** (PM_GetAccelBySpeed: 0.6@210 → 1.1@330, unless
  sliding/ducking) + pm_shared exactness (jump vel 45→35, friction edge-gate, PM_CheckParamters, flymove).
  The original client predicts these; we didn't → persistent smoothed error felt as input lag.
- `fd70541` **cd->fuser1 = frametime** — the missing frametime seam (root cause of the constant 10-20u
  error, `4b79443`). `37b5cd8` **cd->iuser4 = pev->iuser4 (stunt flags)** unconditionally (was m_iPowerups)
  so stunts predict. `9c53268` encumbrance speed via pfnSetClientMaxspeed + GetSpeedBySlots free>80 branch.

**Weapon-state prediction — the "kungfu-for-every-weapon" drop-in bug (dossier `weapon_data_transmission.md`):**
- `8922f0c` the active weapon's predicted state rides the **clientdata vuser channel** (vuser3.x=type,
  .y=fireMode, .z=attach, vuser4.x=altMode, .y=clip, vuser2.x=bloody, vuser2.y=reserve, …), NOT the invented
  GetWeaponData override — the original client reads vuser, so leaving it 0 = kungfu for every weapon.

**Reload prediction:** `380866b` **cd->vuser2.y = active-caliber reserve** (the client refill reads it);
`868c4c1` refill = client full-mag SET (no reserve debit — server owns the reserve, re-seeds via vuser2.y),
server keeps `clip += min(need,reserve)` + debit.

**Fire cadence (dossier `weapon_fire_cadence.md`):** `d18568f` StandardFire semi-with-auto fixed 0.1s rate.
**Teamplay HUD:** `c9df646` dossier (#Spectators / blank-yellow team box RE).

**Akimbo cluster (final front — dossier `akimbo_weaponbar.md`; `1413b7a` dossier, `2bd0319`+`87c21af` fixes):**
1. **vuser4.z is the RELOAD flag, not leftClip** (`2bd0319`): cd+0x1d8 (vuser4.z) = item+0x0c = m_fInReload;
   the akimbo LEFT clip = item+0x1c → **cd+0x70 (ammo_nails)**; client derives rightClip = clip − leftClip
   (RE-confirmed vs `FUN_10003830`). Fixed the reload snap-to-full flicker.
2. **Barrel ALTERNATION** (`87c21af`, `dlls/ts_gun.cpp AkimboFire`): the original `AkimboFire@0x729c0` holds
   the barrel side in ONE per-item byte, **item+0x24 (our it.altMode, rides vuser4.x)**, and
   Primary/SecondaryAttack DON'T touch it for the akimbo (only grenade/knife) — so the per-shot flip
   PERSISTS → true alternation. Ours split the state (m_fInSpecialReload for SEMI, altMode for FREE) AND
   reset it every pull → stuck on one barrel (all-right-then-last-left). Rewrote to the original state
   machine (0=right/1=left; non-free flip+clamp, free button-select, decrement matching barrel, dry only
   when both empty via `Fire()`'s m_iClip<1 gate); removed the Primary/Secondary resets + the dead
   `barrelMask` override; `Fire()`'s 3rd-person shoot pose is now `8+altMode`.
3. **Weapon-bar phantom clip** (`87c21af`, `CTSGun::UpdateClientData`): a parked akimbo/single variant
   showed a stale -1/red cell. Root: our WStatus owned-loop was GATED behind the WeaponInfo early-return +
   we omitted the original's **paired-variant resend**. Fix: hoisted the WStatus loop above the early-return;
   added mechanism B — on active/reserve change resend the active weapon's iAkimboType (weapon_info+0xc8) /
   iSingleType (weapon_info+0xcc) WStatus with their live parked clip → a held akimbo keeps its single's
   cell fresh and vice-versa (matches @0x758c8, both directions).
4. **Deploy body flicker** (`87c21af`): Deploy's draw event now passes iparam2 = equipped attach mask (was
   dead barrelMask, matches original @0x71030); `EV_TSDraw` advances the predicted active type on the deploy
   frame (`TS_SetPredictedWeaponType` in hl_weapons.cpp) so `view.cpp`'s TS_PredictedViewmodelBody asserts
   the akimbo/attachment body AT ONCE (mirrors client.dll `FUN_100425b0`) — kills the single→akimbo lag.

**Verified:** both libs build clean (glibc 2.14, `scripts/build.sh amd64 all`); RE-grounded vs
`ts_i386.so`/`client.dll`. **Behaviour = user playtest** (original hl.exe available for live gdb). **Deploy:**
user ships to the Linux hlds64 test dir — the `game/ts/` worktree deletions are INTENTIONAL (not a bug).
**NEXT / VERIFY:** playtest the akimbo cluster (alternation order right-vs-left, parked bar clip shows real
count, no deploy flicker); `item+0x0c`'s semantic beyond "= m_fInReload" is still VERIFY (LOW); the akimbo
uzi(16) modes = {AUTO, AKIMBO_BOTH} while berettas/MK23/gold = {SEMI, AKIMBO_ALT} (SEMI alternation applies
to the semi-capable akimbos), from the recovered `kFireModes` — not re-derived from the binary this pass.

## 2026-07-05 (cont. 88) — ReHLDS local drop-in test rig + vestigial removal → EXACT entity parity

Added `scripts/setup-rehlds-mod.sh` (deploys our `hl.so` into the `~/Containers/hlds/hlds-linux64-test`
ReHLDS rig via metamod, mirrors `setup-xash-mod.sh`) so we can run our server against a real dedicated engine.
Refreshed the rig engine to current ReHLDS (web-auth commits). **The strict engine (ReHLDS/GoldSrc) vs xash's
lenient late-precache surfaced real drop-in bugs xash hid** — this is precisely why the test matters.

**RE-driven fixes (all committed, ReHLDS `ts_bikini` bot-combat verified, zero Host_Error):**
- `978fab0` **death-drop**: dropped the inherited-stock `PackDeadPlayerItems()` weaponbox drop from
  `PlayerDeathThink` (RE-confirmed the original NEVER instantiates CWeaponBox — both creators
  `PackDeadPlayerItems`/`DropPlayerItem` are 0-caller dead code; TS drops via `TSDropWeaponsOnDeath`). Also
  `CTSGun::Spawn` hardcodes `w_glock18.mdl` (our `pszWorldModel?:w_weaponbox` fallback was invented drift).
- `61aad35`/`2871717` **removed stock weapons (14) + monsters (32)** — all classes RE-verified absent from
  `ts_i386.so`. Kept `hornet.cpp` (CHornet, monster ammo), base classes (`CBaseMonster`/`CTalkMonster`/`CDeadHEV`),
  AI infra (soundent/nodes/schedule/combat). Fixed coupling (weapons.cpp save-tables, hl_weapons.cpp prediction).
- `bd1058c` **`ts_superjump`→`item_longjump`** (name-mismatch DROP-IN BUG): the original registers CTSSuperJump
  under the stock `item_longjump` name; our `ts_superjump` meant map-placed powerups spawned nothing. `b9dc368`
  removed stock CItemLongJump.
- `7d50de1` **registered `info_player_team1-4`** (were MISSING; all → CBaseDMStart, same class as
  info_player_deathmatch, team carried by classname — our CBaseDMStart RE-verified identical to theirs).
- `5a1008f` removed airtank/vehicle/h_cine; unregistered node+scripted entities. `c2c2900` **unregistered
  `func_vip_safetyzone`** (name-mismatch: CVipEscape is a real-but-dead original class, never LINK'd; real
  entity is `ts_teamescape`→CTSTeamEscape). **Entity diff vs original now EXACT: EXTRA none, MISSING none.**

**Method (the win): "verify before removing" caught 2 name-mismatch drop-in bugs (item_longjump, func_vip)** —
an EXTRA entity can be a real class under a different name, not a vestigial. Backing-class check before every
removal.

**Key finding (see HANDOFF PARKED "Trim CBaseMonster"):** the original **removed** the monster-AI schedule +
scripted system from `CBaseMonster` **at source** (proven not-DCE via retained dead code: the unreachable legacy
vgui buy-menu `client.dll@0x10010xxx` with 0 xrefs, + dead-but-present `CVipEscape`). Our kept scripted/nodes
code is inherited base-SDK; entities unregistered = interface parity, but the METHOD-level trim (to the original's
42-method CBaseMonster) is DEFERRED — a ~6-file base-class refactor, flagged in HANDOFF. **User carve-out rule:
keep anniversary/HL25 code even where it diverges from the 2007 original (this AI system is classic → in scope).**

## 2026-07-05 (cont. 88 cont.2) — merged delta.lst (3-way), scope rework, interop rig live

Continuation of cont.88. Commits `da29059` (scope), `f96d71d` (delta+scripts), + docs.

**delta.lst — the interop wire contract.** Diffed original TS (`19af2487`, = what Steam ships) vs
halflife-updated stock (`1aaf1652`, our repo). They split cleanly: **anniversary/HL25 fixes** stock has
(eflags 1→2 EFLAG_FLESH_SOUND, skin 9→12, m_iId 5→6, iuser1/2 adds, fuser2/3 widths, animtime encoding) vs
**TS wire additions** the original has (iuser3 + iuser4 32-bit in clientdata/entity_state/player — the powerup
game-state networking, the old `[open decision]`). Built the **merged table via a field-level 3-WAY MERGE**
from the 1998 SDK seed (`de70fad`) as common ancestor: seed + TS-branch + anniversary-branch. Add/add overlap
on iuser1/iuser2 (both branches added them, different widths) → resolved to **max width** (iuser1=5, iuser2=6;
iuser2=6 is REQUIRED for spectate player-index 32 — the naive eyeball missed it, the 3-way caught it).
**Verified against CODE:** all 226 fields are real struct members (`common/entity_state.h` etc.); bit-widths
hold the written values (`cd->iuser4 = pl->m_iPowerups` already written, client.cpp:2122). It's a minimal
WIDENING of the TS table → drop-in with the original client (GoldSrc transmits the SERVER's table at connect,
so the client adapts; widening is decode-safe). Committed as `network/delta.lst` + 3-way inputs in
`reference/dossiers/cont88/`.

**Scope rework — killed an INVENTED asset.** `ts_scopefull.spr` (round-7l: quarterscope mirrored 4x, baked +
committed) does NOT exist in the original. RE (client.dll scope draw @0x10054516) shows the original ships only
`quarterscope.spr` (one quarter, SPR_INDEXALPHA black mask) and paints it **4x-rotated via TriAPI** at render
time. Reworked `cl_dll/ts_scope.cpp` to match (screen-space TriAPI quads, uv(1,1)=circle centre; black side bars
drawn first + 1px overlap for the seam). Removed the baked sprite. Visual-verified in xash (transparent circle,
clean seam). **Lesson: assets referenced in a decompile must exist in our code — diff asset refs per class.**

**Deploy-script clobber bug (cost real cleanup).** The rig's `ts/delta.lst`/`ts/sprites` are SYMLINKS into the
pristine `~/Containers/hlds/mods/ts`; a `cp -f` wrote THROUGH them and clobbered the original TS `delta.lst`
(restored from `recovered/ts3-linux/ts/delta.lst`) + leaked a sprite. Both `setup-{rehlds,xash}-mod.sh` now use
`cp --remove-destination` (writes a real file, breaks the symlink) — never plain `cp -f` onto a symlinked path.

**Interop rig LIVE:** ReHLDS server (merged delta.lst, rcbot `max_bots 4`) + xash client up for the user to test
both drop-in directions. End-to-end powerup confirmation pending. HANDOFF "START HERE (cont.88)" is the pickup.

## 2026-07-04 (cont. 87d) — CI made green: build source-list sync + MSVC-compat fixes

First-ever CI run on the repo surfaced two classes of latent breakage (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
has 6 jobs: Linux-{i386×2,amd64,aarch64}, Win32, Win64). Commits `67579f2..686eb88` on
`restructure-source-parity`, fast-forwarded to `main` and pushed. **Final: all 6 jobs green.**

- **Build source-list drift (the trigger).** `hl.so`/`client.so` compile through FOUR parallel build
  systems, each with its own explicit `.cpp` list: the CMake authority (`dlls/`+`cl_dll/CMakeLists.txt`,
  used by amd64/aarch64/win64), the legacy i386 Makefiles (`linux/Makefile.hldll`+`Makefile.hl_cdll`,
  the `linux-i386` job), and the VS2019 vcxprojs (`projects/vs2019/hldll.vcxproj`+`hl_cdll.vcxproj`
  +`.filters`, the `win32` job). Every reconstructed TS file had only ever been added to CMake, so the
  Makefile/MSBuild jobs never compiled them. Synced all four hand-maintained lists to CMake: server =
  26 TS `dlls/` sources (`ts_*`/`TS_*`/`hldmcompat`) + `pm_shared/TS_pm_shared`; client = 18 `cl_dll/`
  TS sources (`ts_*`/`ev_ts`/`roundtime`) + 3 shared weapon srcs (`ts_shared`/`ts_weapon_info`/`ts_gun`)
  from `dlls/` + `TS_pm_shared`. Verified by building the EXACT CI i386 path locally (`cd linux && make
  COMPILER=g++ CFG=release`): both `.so` clean, `--no-undefined` server link = no missing symbols, no
  further files surfaced (the CMake list was complete). Commit `67579f2`.
- **Guard: `scripts/check-source-lists.py`** (commit `6b48d6d`). Normalizes every `.cpp` each build system
  compiles to a repo-relative path and set-compares the Makefile+vcxproj against the CMake authority,
  per target, printing MISSING/EXTRA and exiting non-zero on drift (stdlib-only, negative-tested). Run it
  whenever a source file is added/removed. Referenced from `CLAUDE.md §3`.
- **MSVC-compat bugs the Win32/Win64 jobs then exposed** (gcc's `-w` on Linux had hidden them; Win64 is
  CMake so it was already failing at `fad367a`, before this session). Commit `686eb88`:
  - `dlls/TS_util.cpp` used raw POSIX `strcasecmp` (error C3861 on MSVC, lines 40+204) → SDK-portable
    `stricmp` (`common/Platform.h` maps it to `_stricmp`/`strcasecmp`), matching the rest of the tree.
  - `pm_shared/pm_shared.cpp` `PM_Jump` had a leftover unreferenced `int i;` (warning C4101 → fatal under
    the vcxproj's warnings-as-errors) → removed; `i` was unused in the whole function post-reconstruction.
  - amd64 server+client build green (glibc 2.14), server nm-T unchanged (872), no behavioural change.

Method note: `gh run view --log-failed` + grep for `error C####`/file-level diagnostics pinned the exact
files/lines fast; the user (watching the run) flagged "Win32 'i' variable, Win64 strcasecmp" which matched.
Next: nothing outstanding on CI; resume the audit.py per-class parity loop.

## 2026-07-04 (cont. 87 cont.3) — LARGE playtest-driven fix batch (all user-verified, RE-grounded)

A long interactive session on `restructure-source-parity`; every fix RE'd from the original then
user-verified in-engine. Commits after `19efde0`. Method: dossier-subagents for deep client.dll RE
(spine merge, 3rd-person camera, status HUD, drop mechanism) + live user playtest as ground truth.

- **3rd-person SPINE TWIST** (`4a0b466`): gait merge left the torso pose on the spine (Bip01 Dorso) atop a
  gait-rotated parent → double-rotated upper body. Original `StudioSetupBones` (FUN_10031080) re-bases the
  split bone's yaw = (torso_yaw − gait_yaw) then breaks. Added `QuaternionAngles`. Dossier cont87/spine_blend.
- **Reticle crosshair only for guns** (`05d2d3e`) + **3rd-person knife/katana block anim** (`600328e`): block
  keyed off the empty `m_szAnimExtention` → fell to kungfu_block; original uses `m_szAnimOverride` (@0x5d8d0 case 0x26).
- **TS OVER-THE-SHOULDER 3rd-person CAMERA + screen-space RETICLE** (`f4b9637`): NOT the stock distance-orbit —
  `cl_camtype` (0-3) preset back/right/up offset (0=−48/+16/+12; user runs 3=cam_back 90 centered), render
  camera uses SMOOTHED cam_ofs angles. Reticle = WorldToScreen of the traced aim point from the EYE (new
  `v_aimeye`, pre-offset), so it shows true aim + parallaxes/lags. Framerate-dependent /4 smoothing kept
  faithful (100fps). Dossier cont87/thirdperson_camera_reticle.
- **SPAWN loadout fixes** (`5244abf`): (1) SlotsUsed counted kung-fu (TSW_MELEE, cost 10) → full loadout hit 90
  server-side and dropped the last weapon; skip TSW_MELEE. (2) TSDeployArsenal deployed the last-bought; use
  GetBetterWeapon(-1) → spawn on the highest-priority weapon (M4). Root found via user's "11 free slots" clue.
- **Ammo HUD** (`4bb03c2`): caliber/firemode → full color (were gray); DrawNumberPair `[  a  /  b  ]`;
  TSHud_DrawString confirmed = DrawCharacter (NOT DrawConsoleString — that adds a xash shadow; bold/opacity
  is the xash vs GoldSrc engine font, not ours).
- **WEAPON-SELECT RIGHT-CLICK DROP** (`5c14b90`): merged our two wrongly-split DropWeapon()/DropWeapon(int,float)
  into the original's ONE `DropWeapon(int type,float)` (@0x84900; type<0=active/-1 key/-2 disarm, type>=0=specific);
  added the `drop_<N>` ClientCommand + `CL_ResetButtonBits` now resets IN_ATTACK2 (was IN_ATTACK-only) so the
  right-click no longer leaks into the weapon secondary. Dossier cont87/weapon_drop.
- **Low-stamina BREATHING** (`…`): client-side breathe2.wav (loop-marked 'cue' chunk) while melee bar <50%,
  EDGE-triggered (EV_PlaySound/EV_StopSound on CHAN_STATIC — survives pickups, stops on recovery).
- **SPAWN button clean** (`…`): StopObserver clears `pev->button` + m_afButtonPressed (RE @0x99a14, was missing) —
  no auto-fire from fire-to-play; AND `inputw32.cpp` keeps `mouse_oldbuttonstate` in sync while the buy menu
  absorbs clicks (the early return froze it → a phantom +attack on menu close fired the fresh weapon — the
  user's exact "buy-menu click → fire on spawn" repro). `0xb34` un-RE'd (no read site) ~= the button-edge cache.
- **Knife ammo count** (`…`): knife/sealknife carry count rides the WeaponInfo reserve field (0 for caliber-less
  melee) → drawn as a number above the block bar (LK_COUNT).
- **Powerup FIGURE icons + `powerup 7`** (`…`): the two persistent indicators used the weapon-bar icon + a
  non-existent superjump.spr (SPR_Load stale handle → drew the last weapon/numbers sprite); fixed to
  `sprites/player/kungfu.spr` + `sprites/player/movement.spr` side-by-side @ SH-56. Added `powerup 7` (grant
  kung-fu — debug, nothing in the shipped game grants it; same divergence as `powerup 6`).
- **Pump-shotgun 3rd-person reload** (`…`): removed the invented `Animate(TSA_RELOAD)` from ShotgunReload —
  RE-confirmed the original never animates the shell-by-shell reload. Shell-for-shell shotguns (Mossberg/Benelli)
  show no world reload; clip shotguns (USAS/Sawed-off) keep the whole-mag anim (standard Reload).

Method wins: the user's diagnoses were repeatedly the RE-correct root (button-clean vs swallow flag; the
mouse_oldbuttonstate freeze; the kung-fu slot). Several "invented stand-ins" removed (ShotgunReload anim,
DropWeapon split, superjump.spr). All build-green, server nm-T stable, deployed each step.

## 2026-07-04 (cont. 87 cont.2) — TS over-the-shoulder 3rd-person CAMERA + screen-space-mapped RETICLE (user-verified aim)

Commit `f4b9637` (feat) + `1086ff0` (dossier `reference/dossiers/cont87/thirdperson_camera_reticle.md` + decomps).
Build-green, server nm-T unchanged (client-only), deployed. RE: client.dll `V_CalcNormalRefdef` @0x67890.

The big finding: TS 3rd-person is NOT the stock `cam_idealdist` straight-back distance orbit our view.cpp had —
it's an **over-the-shoulder OFFSET camera** driven by cvar **`cl_camtype`** (0-3). `CAM_Think` is kept stock
(smooths `cam_ofs` pitch/yaw toward the view via `MoveToward`); the DIRECTION comes from cam_ofs, the POSITION
from a preset back/right/up offset. Implemented:
- **`cl_camtype` presets** (in_camera.cpp cvars cl_camtype/cam_back/cam_right/cam_up + view.cpp switch): camtype 0
  (default, RE'd binary default) = back-48/right+16/up+12; 1 = -48/-16/+12; 2 = -90/0/+12; **3 = cam_back/cam_right/
  cam_up (90/0/12) = centered+zoomed**. Clamps back[-128,24], side/up[-24,24]. ⚠ **camtype 2 and 3 are IDENTICAL
  with default cvars** (both back -90 centered); camtype 3 is the CVAR-TUNABLE one (`cam_back 110` zooms 3 further,
  mode 2 is fixed). The user's original runs camtype 3 (their config); the CLEAN original ships config.cfg
  `cl_camtype "0"` + CAM_Init default "0", so our registration default is "0" (faithful) — the ref rig's
  config.cfg is set to 3 (user preference).
- **Render camera = SMOOTHED cam_ofs angles** (view.cpp `VectorCopy(camAngles, pparams->viewangles)`, RE 0x67d60):
  the rig orbits with rotational lag. The `/4`-per-frame ease is FRAMERATE-DEPENDENT (RE: MoveToward FUN_10024ba0
  = stock, 1-degree snap + *0.25/frame). Original ran ~100fps → visible small-turn lag; at high fps it catches up
  in fewer ms so the lag hides on small turns. **User chose to KEEP it faithful (not frametime-normalize)** — it's
  the original's actual behavior; run `fps_max 100` to match the feel.
- **RETICLE = WorldToScreen of the TRACED AIM POINT from the player EYE** (ts_reticle.cpp), NOT pinned to center.
  KEY FIX: trace from **`v_aimeye`** (new view.cpp global = simorg+view_ofs, captured BEFORE the 3rd-person offset)
  = the bullet origin, NOT the offset camera `v_origin` (tracing from the camera put the hit dead-ahead → always
  centered → wrong aim + no parallax). Now the reticle shows where shots ACTUALLY land (accuracy correct at any
  shoulder offset) and screen-space-maps the aim (strafing parallaxes it, turning trails it). ✅ user: "aim is correct".

Method: dossier-subagent RE'd client.dll (kept ~130k decompile tokens out of context); then iterated live with the
user (ground truth) — the eye-vs-camera trace origin + the framerate cause of the lag threshold were both settled by
the user's playtest observations ("screen space mapping the traced location", "original is 100fps, mine is 240"). The
reticle-lag mechanism (C) was LOW-confidence in the dossier and got PINNED by the user's observations, not static RE.

⚠ VERIFY still open: the dynamic back-ease (48->92 under the `localplayer+0x26c & 0x130c30` gate) is omitted — camtype
3 (back 90) already gives the zoomed framing, so it's cosmetic; needs a live gate read if pursued.

## 2026-07-04 (cont. 87 cont.) — melee 3rd-person fidelity: crosshair gun-gate + knife/katana block anim (both user-verified)

Commits `05d2d3e` (crosshair) + `600328e` (block). Build-green, server nm-T unchanged, deployed, ✅ user-verified.
- **Reticle crosshair only for guns** (`05d2d3e`): the reticle's aiming crosshair (donut "sight" sprite + NSEW
  ticks, ts_reticle.cpp) drew for ALL weapons. Only firearms should show it; melee/grenade/flag show just the
  dive/weight "(" arc. Added `TS_ActiveWeaponIsGun()` (ts_weaponbar.cpp, decl ts_hud.h) = active weaponType's
  s_weaponColumn category >= 2 (the RE'd s_weapon_info +0x84 byte; 1=melee/grenade/flag, 2-5=guns). Gated
  lines 104-117 on it, keeping the arc/laser/distance readout intact.
- **3rd-person knife/katana block anim** (`600328e`): HandleCloseCombat's block case picked katana_block/
  knife_block/kungfu_block off `m_szAnimExtention` — EMPTY for all melee (grip "") → both knife AND katana
  fell through to the generic `kungfu_block`. RE-confirmed asm-exact (HandleCloseCombat @0x5d8d0 case 0x26):
  the original keys off `m_szAnimOverride` (player+0x478, the blade idle override "katana_idle"/"knife_idle").
  Swapped the field. NOTE: "block (+reload)" — the block is bound to IN_RELOAD (the reload key IS block); there
  is no separate melee reload anim (no `_reload` string in the binary). FLAGGED (task): TSA_CC_STOCK case 0x27
  appends `field_0xb58` in the original, we append m_szAnimExtention — un-RE'd twin field, low-pri edge case.

Method: `re.sh 0x6d8d0` decompiled HandleCloseCombat typed → the exact field. Mission rule 1 in action (a wrong
FIELD hid the bug: the selector was built against the empty grip instead of the blade override).

Still OPEN (user-driven, 3rd-person subsystem, RE agent running): #3 reticle should FLOAT/LAG behind mouse in
3rd person (original does, ours pins to center) — REOPENED after a wrong close; #4 3rd-person ORBIT camera
(zoomed out more + orbit behavior). Both = client.dll camera/reticle RE (cont87 dossier agent in flight).

## 2026-07-03 (cont. 87) — 3rd-person spine twist (upper body looking left while moving w/ melee) FIXED — split-bone yaw re-base

Commit `4a0b466` (fix) + `031bd75` (dossier `reference/dossiers/cont87/spine_blend.md`). Build-green, server
nm-T unchanged (client-only), deployed, ✅ user-verified ("looks correct").

**Symptom:** in 3rd person, moving (walk/run) while holding a melee weapon (katana/knife), OUR client twisted
the upper body/spine sideways (torso faced a different direction than the legs). Original keeps it aligned. User
screenshots confirmed a spine kink.

**Root cause:** our gait bone-merge in `StudioSetupBones` (`cl_dll/StudioModelRenderer.cpp`) hard-copied the gait
pose into bones up to the spine (`Bip01 Dorso`), then LEFT the torso's authored local pose on that split bone —
which sat atop a gait-rotated parent chain → the whole upper body was DOUBLE-rotated → the kink. (Our old code
was the stock-HL hard-copy + the italian `Bip01 Dorso` name; it MISSED the TS-specific re-base.)

**Fix (RE'd asm-exact, dossier-subagent, keeps decompile out of context):** the original client.dll
`StudioSetupBones` (`FUN_10031080` @ RVA 0x31080) re-bases the split bone: snapshot the torso root yaw BEFORE the
copy loop overwrites `q[0]` with the gait root; copy gait up to the first `Bip01 Dorso`/`Bip01 Spine`; at that
bone set `yawDelta = torso_root_yaw − gait_root_yaw` and inject it into the spine's local ROLL (index 0, the
twist axis for the italian Dorso whose local-X runs up the spine) via QuaternionAngles→AngleQuaternion, then
`break`. Re-basing the single Dorso bone rotates the ENTIRE upper body (all upper bones are its children) back
into aim alignment. Added `QuaternionAngles` (quat→euler, asin-pitch form; `FUN_1002ffe0` = QuaternionMatrix +
MatrixAngles) to `studio_util.cpp/.h` — quat→angles was missing from our tree.

Helper IDs (all HIGH, asm-traced): 0x2fdf0=QuaternionMatrix, 0x2fbd0=AngleQuaternion, 0x2fef0=MatrixAngles,
0x2ffe0=QuaternionAngles, 0x2fa90=ConcatTransforms, 0x30010=quat copy. Angle convention [0]=roll,[1]=pitch,[2]=yaw.
Only MED-confidence piece = the gimbal-lock fold eps (inert for spine/root bones, never near ±90°).

Method: focused general-purpose dossier-subagent decompiled the merge fn + math helpers, IDed each, derived the
exact split algorithm, cross-checked vs stock-HL gait merge, and returned a drop-in using our var names. Cleared
the cont.86 gait "QUESTION 3" head-turn item (the authored knife_idle head pose was a red herring — the real
divergence was this missing spine re-base). Superseded the reverted gait Fix 1 (`fps*dt`, #14 was a separate speed
concern; line 1441 remains plain `fps*dt`).

**Next:** the reverted #14 walk2/run2 gait SPEED item (separate from this twist) still open if it re-surfaces;
HUD bottom-left layout; HUD powerup icons; audit.py parity loop; iuser4-on-the-wire decision.

## 2026-07-03 (cont. 86 cont.3) — gait speed + player blob shadow (IN PROGRESS, uncommitted) + full HANDOFF for next agent

Dossier `reference/dossiers/cont86/gait_and_shadow.md`. Two CLIENT presentation items, deployed + pending user verify:
- **walk2/run2 gait too fast** (#14): Fix 1 applied (`StudioModelRenderer.cpp:1441` in-place gait `fps*dt` →
  `curstate.framerate*fps*dt`, RE `StudioProcessGait @0x2250`). ⚠ our server never sets `pev->framerate` by speed
  → Fix 1 may no-op; fallback = DIVERGENCE 2 (`m_fGaitEstimation` flag) or a server framerate write. Playtest-driven.
- **player blob shadow** (#15): `TS_Shadows_Draw` (`ts_attachments.cpp`+`.h`, called from `tri.cpp`) — `ombra.spr`
  ground blob, `cl_shadow`-gated, trace-down + alpha falloff + 24u quad. Orig = client.dll FUN_10055760/FUN_10055500
  from `HUD_DrawTransparentTriangles @0x34e50`. Won't audit-flag (client.dll stripped = "unverifiable" bucket).
HANDOFF rewritten (`START HERE cont.86d`) with the full mission/methods/tooling/asset-check/scratchpad direction
for the next orchestrator. Memory `[[dead-code-path-gravity-trap]]` added. Commits through `975011c`; gait/shadow uncommitted.

## 2026-07-03 (cont. 86 cont.2) — SUPER-JUMP + SLOW-MOTION reconstructed to the real mechanisms (both hard to find; both user-verified)

Two subsystems that were LONG mis-implemented as playtest-tuned approximations got reconstructed to their actual
mechanisms via dossier-subagents (`reference/dossiers/cont86/{superjump_moongravity.md,slowmo_movement.md}` +
raw decompiles). All build-green, nm-T stable, deployed. Commits: slow-motion `29e4861`, super-jump `725fb66`.

### ⭐ SUPER-JUMP — the whole thing was invented; the real mechanism is a physinfo key + a pm_shared jump gate
The old superjump was a from-scratch `m_bLowGravity` PreThink sustained-velocity lift (fuel/hover/ceiling-clamp
with MADE-UP constants 240/300/1.2) — no counterpart in the binary. The user flagged it ("you seem to be
inventing code"). The REAL mechanism (all HIGH-confidence, raw-verified):
- **Physinfo key `"mj"`** (moon-jump; string @ .so vaddr 0xf791d) — the grant (`PlayerAddPowerUp`, `SetPlayerTheOne`,
  `TSInit` map-global) sets `pfnSetPhysicsKeyValue(edict,"mj","1")` = the ABILITY only, gravity stays normal.
  (Our old comment CALLED this "mj" but dismissed it as invented lore; it was RIGHT. Also: our `PM_Jump` was
  reading the STOCK HL `"slj"` long-jump key, doing the forward long-jump — wrong key AND wrong jump.)
- **`PM_Jump`** (pm_shared): `"mj"`==1 + DUCK + on-ground → ONE-SHOT vertical `velocity.z = sqrt(160000) = 400`
  (const is a DOUBLE @0x100bc8; base jump = sqrt(56000)≈236.6 @0x100bb8) + `iuser4 |= 0x200000` (WHEEL_TRIG).
- **`CTSStunt::Play`**: WHEEL_TRIG → WHEEL_DONE (0x100000, the flight-active bit) + morfy_jump pose + airwheel
  (existing handler — the flight anim came FREE).
- **`PM_CheckParamters`** (pm_shared @0xe9c94) = the piece that was missed twice: VARIABLE JUMP HEIGHT. While
  `iuser4 & 0x100000`: reduce air control (fwd*0.5, side/up*0.25) and GATE GRAVITY ON `IN_JUMP` — held = 0.30
  rising / 0.75 falling (climb), released = 1.0 (drop). NO hold-timer (cap emergent: 400 decays under 0.30).
- **Landing** (PostThink @0x81a22): WHEEL_DONE + onground → screen shake + `GoRoll` (DUCK) or the superjump_land plant.
- ⚠ **THE TRAP (cost a whole wrong REV):** `UpdatePowerUpState` HAS a `m_iPowerups & 0x100 → gravity=0.15` branch,
  but it's **DEAD CODE for the superjump** (PlayerAddPowerUp never writes `m_iPowerups` for LOWGRAV — only
  `m_bLowGravity`+`"mj"`, then returns). The first dossier REV read that dead path and concluded "constant 0.15
  while held" — WRONG (float just from holding the powerup; overshot ~2×). The user's playtest caught it. Lesson:
  a reachable-looking gravity write can be DEAD — verify the gating bit is actually SET on the path you care about.
- Debug hook: `powerup 6` grants LOWGRAV (swap-in-safe — server-side console cmd, wire name/format unchanged).

### ⭐ SLOW-MOTION — the original slows TIME, not velocity (fixes the kick gate)
The mid-air side-kick gate `speed>270` (plain `|velocity|`, NO slow-divide — verified in CCombatAttack @0x76078)
failed in OUR slowmo but works in the original. Cause: the original slows MOVEMENT purely by time-dilating the
pm_shared frametime — **`PM_PlayerMove` @0xf08d8: `frametime *= fuser1`** — leaving `pev->velocity` (units/sec)
UNTOUCHED, so `|velocity|` stays high and >270 passes. OUR bug: `pev->maxspeed *= fuser1` every PreThink, capping
achievable `|velocity|` (and networked → client predicted it too). Fix: `maxspeed = GetSpeedBySlots` (no fuser1) +
the frametime dilation in PM_PlayerMove (guarded `fuser1>0` so an unpopulated field can't freeze). User-verified.

### METHOD: dossier-subagents nailed both
Two `general-purpose` agents (self-contained prompts w/ addr-base rules + the exact questions) produced the
dossiers while keeping ~350k tokens of decompile out of the main context. The superjump agent's FIRST rev was
wrong (dead-code path) — a SendMessage follow-up with the user's precise behavioral spec got the right answer.
Cross-check agent labels against the live playtest (the user is ground truth). [[live-original-ts-debuggable]]

Still OPEN (agents/tasks): walk2/run2 gait speed should scale to velocity (#14), player blob-shadow sprite
(likely `ombra.spr`, #15) — a combined RE agent is running. Also: iuser4-on-the-wire decision (delta.lst) for
powerup client-prediction; HUD layout (#4), powerup HUD icons (#7), audit.py parity loop (#8).

## 2026-07-03 (cont. 86 cont.) — kick/punch/anim fidelity batch + original-content rig swap + delta.lst revert + double-fire fix

Continuation of cont.86. All build-green, nm-T stable, deployed, USER-VERIFIED each. Commits `40f6f59..6f93900`.

Gameplay/anim fixes (all user-verified "matches original"):
- **Kick land-low getup** (`5e46c99`,`05975a3`): player+0x78 = STOCK `CBaseAnimating::m_fSequenceFinished`
  (live-traced, not a TS latch — see [[stock-member-before-inventing]]). Getup = `roll!=0 && (roll<0.01 ||
  m_fSequenceFinished)`. HandleSlide forces =1 for instant slide-standup. Two prior sessions invented a
  "latch" member here; deleted. DO-NOT-TOUCH markers in source.
- **Sidekick FPV** (`b258dd1`): client `UTIL_MakeVectors` was the stock EMPTY stub → predicted
  gpGlobals->v_forward=0 → fwdDot=0.00 vs server 0.88 → wrong CCombatAttack branch (B5 air kick not B3
  side kick). Implemented via AngleVectors. Dual-side [CCK] trace confirmed parity.
- **3rd-person kick anims + duck eye** (`d6f03e4`): Animate close-combat HOLD rebuilt decompile-exact
  (raw @0x6bf20): while a full-body CC seq plays, a plain RUN/IDLE RETURNS (holds torso+legs; live-verified
  gaitsequence stays 0 through the whole sidekick). m_iLastActivity updates on the CC dispatch frame.
  VEC_DUCK_VIEW 12→16 (original PM_Duck writes 16, live viewz=16).
- **Punch/kick combo cadence** (`ba5c6dc`,`4d22c1b`): player+0x814/0x815 = STOCK `m_afButtonPressed`
  (PreThink edge trio +0x810/814/818). D2 punchright = pressed&IN_ATTACK; B4a kick-finisher =
  pressed&IN_ATTACK2. Spaced click = right hook/finisher; held = jab/circkick chain. [[stock-member-before-inventing]]
- **Play ladder/water abort** (`295b777`): decompile-exact (clears WHEEL_DONE not DIVE; exact 9-bit reset;
  invented TS_ResetStuntState helper w/ invented STANDUP-set deleted — nothing in the binary sets iuser4 bit 8).
- **DoubleFireRate 1.5x once** (`6f93900`): was applied in the RE-faithful PostThink timer-decrement
  (slowFrametime*=1.5) AND duplicated at fire-arm in 3 spots (StandardFire /1.5, ShotgunFire /1.5,
  double-barrel *0.5=2x) → 2.25x/3x. Removed the 3 duplicates; PostThink decrement is the sole mechanism.

Package/rig investigation (user-driven):
- **ts-3-final download == our reference/** (all 3 binaries byte-identical, both Linux tar + Windows exe).
  The Windows Clickteam SFX and the Linux tar ship the IDENTICAL 1127-file set including ALL 4 binaries
  (mp.dll+client.dll+ts_i386.so+ts_i686.so) — "one cross-platform set, packaged twice", 0 file diffs.
  TSHD3's delta.lst is byte-identical to the original's (19af2487); TSHD3's fixes are in binaries/content.
- **Rig content SWAP**: `~/Containers/hlds/mods/ts` was TSHD3-based + ~5800 custom files (1.2G). Backed up
  to `~/Containers/hlds/mods/ts-TSHD3-backup-cont86.tar`, replaced with the clean original (1127 files, 29
  ts_* maps). ⚠ tm_avana GONE (custom map, in backup) — playtest on ts_dojo/ts_lobby/ts_metro now.
- **delta.lst reverted to 3b1d963** (`df56f06`): our network/delta.lst was halflife-updated's table (2013
  Valve seed → 2021-24 HL upstream) + our 2 edits (b2b512e m_iWeaponState 2→4, c1013a9 iuser4). The only
  post-3b1d963 commits were both ours; revert = clean upstream base. ⚠ iuser4 no longer on the wire → client
  can't predict powerup-gated behavior (double-fire is server-authoritative now). Re-adding iuser4 (original
  TS table nets it at 32 bits) is the trigger to restore that prediction — an OPEN decision.

Method wins: LIVE gdb value-watch on the running original (view_ofs.z/iuser4/sequence, roll timer printed
as a relative timestamp) settled player+0x78 = m_fSequenceFinished; DEBUG-ALERT dual-side [CCK]/[HCC]/[SYNC]/[ST]
in OUR build isolated each branch/state divergence. Two "TS mystery members" (0x78, 0x814) both turned out
STOCK — check the SDK base-class chain FIRST.

Still open (tasks): #4 HUD bottom-left layout, #6 superjump hold-space, #7 powerup HUD icons, #8 audit.py
parity loop, #9 m_fSequenceFinished usage parity (Animate x13/BulletDance), #11 pm_shared (TSHandle cmd-move
damp/PseudoClimb/PM_Duck 0x30C3C mask). OPEN DECISION: iuser4 back on the wire (original TS delta table) vs stay clean upstream.

## 2026-07-03 (cont. 86) — kick land-low recover SOLVED: player+0x78 = stock m_fSequenceFinished (✅ user: "exactly matches the original")

Commits `40f6f59..05975a3` on `restructure-source-parity`, all build-green + nm-T stable + deployed.
The cont.85 "flat 2s" mystery closed in three steps, each falsifying the previous theory:
1. **ALERT-instrumented playtest**: our server roll timer was NEVER broken — decrements during the fall
   (land with roll=1.4/1.0 on jump/2nd-story kicks), getup always 2.0s from the KICK. Client-prediction
   theory dead. But the user's original-side timings (ground kick ~1s, jump ~0.75s, 2nd-story shorter)
   showed the ORIGINAL recovers ~2x faster than the 2.0 arm.
2. **Exhaustive static scans** (all iuser4 bit writes, PRONE clears, view_ofs writers, +0x78 stores):
   found the getup reads player+0x78 which "only HandleSlide writes" → shipped a wrong "sticky flag"
   reading (40f6f59, also fixed real getup drift: exact clear set ROLL|0x80000|PRONE|STOP|0x2, friction-only,
   no stuntTime zero, no stood-up gate on HandleStunt; killed the invented STANDUP-bit note: NOTHING sets bit 8).
3. **LIVE TRACE settled it** (hw watchpoints on view_ofs.z/iuser4/player+0x68 with the roll timer printed
   as a relative timestamp): the getup fires at roll=1.07/0.99 ≈ exactly when the ~1s kick ANIM completes;
   mp.dll's flag writers are inlined StudioFrameAdvance/ResetSequenceInfo tails ⇒ **player+0x78 (.so) /
   +0x68 (mp.dll) is STOCK CBaseAnimating::m_fSequenceFinished** (gcc2 vs MSVC base offsets). Getup =
   `roll!=0 && (roll<0.01 || m_fSequenceFinished)` — "timer OR anim-sequence end"; HandleSlide's =1 is a
   forced sequence-finish. Fix (5e46c99): getup reads m_fSequenceFinished (PostThink StudioFrameAdvance
   already advances it), invented m_iStandUpLatch/m_iSlideStandUp member DELETED. ✅ User-verified exact;
   DO-NOT-TOUCH markers committed (05975a3). Memory: [[stock-member-before-inventing]].
Why we got it wrong twice: the store-scan dismissed StudioFrameAdvance/ResetSequenceInfo writes to
this+0x78 as "another class's member" — CBasePlayer IS-A CBaseAnimating.
Discovered-not-chased (tasks): Animate's 13 m_fSequenceFinished read-sites vs ours + BulletDance read (#9);
Play ladder/water branch clears WHEEL_DONE not DIVE + exact reset set (#10); original TSHandle damps
cmd moves (not velocity) + PseudoClimb head + PM_Duck gate mask is 0x30C3C not 0x3CC3C (un-tasked, pm_shared).
Next: #2 sidekick FPV branch parity, #3/#4 HUD color/layout, #6 superjump, #8 parity loop.

## 2026-07-03 (cont. 85/86) — kung-fu kick chain + 3rd-person gait + weapon-data audit + stunt getup (session close)

User-driven playtest loop on `restructure-source-parity`. All build-green (`scripts/build.sh amd64 all`),
nm-T stable, deployed to the xash rig each time. Full pickup detail is in **HANDOFF.md cont.86** (the START-
HERE block); decode dossiers preserved + committed at **`reference/dossiers/cont85/`** (`kick_decode.md`,
`anim_statemachine.md`, the raw decompiles). Commits `6b3b3db..d7f74f9`.

Done (verified from the decompile, not guessed):
- **W_Precache CRASH FIX** (in HEAD from compaction): stock-HL `W_Precache` precached `weapon_shotgun` etc.
  which TS remaps onto `CTSGroundWeapon` (no `GetItemInfo` slot) → SIGSEGV via `UTIL_PrecacheOtherWeapon`.
  Reconstructed decompile-exact (`@0xe12e8`): `item_suit` + TS entities via `UTIL_PrecacheOther`, one
  `UTIL_PrecacheOtherWeapon("weapon_tsgun")`.
- **CCombatAttack (kung-fu) rebuilt** (`@0x76078`, `29bb434`): flDamage = the SPEED-SCALED lunge (also the
  whiff-lunge on miss), NOT flat 35/45/55 (= trace REACH); iAnim = MOVE-ID (0x0a..0x19 == m_lastMeleeAnim).
- **CTSAnimation 3rd-person gait** (`@0x5b470`, `8f496cf`): TWO seqs/frame (TORSO `pev->sequence` + LEGS
  `pev->gaitsequence`) + a body→legs sync for bare hands; fire/reload FALL THROUGH to the gait block.
- **animation "snapping" fixed** (`479122d`): the leg block's `SetAnim(TSSA_LEGS)` (no INTERP bit) ran
  `pev->effects |= EF_NOINTERP` every grounded frame → killed model interpolation. Set `gaitsequence`
  DIRECTLY (inline, no helper — user caught my invented `SetGait`).
- **sawed-off shell-retained reload** (`d850ba6`/`dd3f9d3`, user-approved improvement): event phase 8 when a
  shell is chambered → block[8]; use `m_iClip` LIVE not the parked `m_pActiveItem->clip`.
- **weapon grips = original `szAnimExt`** (`34a94c6`): m61/knife/katana/sealknife/flag = EMPTY `""` (not
  `nullptr`→"onehanded"). ⚠ I first INVENTED `"m61_grenade"` — that string is the thrown-grenade ENTITY
  CLASSNAME (`fn @0x6c850`/`CM61Grenade`), NOT an anim-ext. Lesson: a `.rodata` string existing ≠ the field's
  value; trace the actual assignment. [[weapon-table-verify-source]]
- **DATA AUDIT (clean):** `Sparta()` (`@0x6fa78`, 32 firearms × spread/viewKick/recoil/dmg) matches the
  original BYTE-EXACT (hex-float diff). `extract_weapons.py` numeric columns are UNRELIABLE (wrong offsets) —
  verify at the real `Write_<weapon>` store. Write vs Sparta = two datasets, each matching its own original.
- **stunt getup on the stand-up latch** (`13d808d`): `CTSStunt::Play` getup now fires on `m_flRollTime<0.01
  || m_iStandUpLatch` (player+0x78) matching `@0x8a014`; HandleSlide already set the latch on landing.

UNRESOLVED (the cont.86 live pickup — priority order in HANDOFF):
1. **Kick recover flat ~2s** (`d7f74f9` WIP): fuser1 confirmed **1.0** live, roll arm **2.0** in the
   decompile → server math is 2.0s, but the ORIGINAL is height/air-time dependent (roll decrements during
   the fall). STRONG SUSPECT: the local view is CLIENT-PREDICTED and `Play`/the getup doesn't run in the
   client predictor. DO NOT re-fudge the arm (user: "no stopgaps").
2. **Sidekick FPV** plays the regular kick, not "sidekick" — SERVER picks B3 correctly (debug-ALERT
   confirmed), so the CLIENT's PREDICTED CCombatAttack hits a different branch. Make predicted state parity.
3-4. **HUD color** (stale cfg 125/150/165 vs original 150/175/255) + **HUD bottom-left layout** (team label,
   free-slots section, smaller health) — client VGUI, live-RE `client.dll`.
5. **Superjump** hold-space-only after launch (preserve stock duck+jump). **HUD powerup icons** (opacity +
   two-icon). **Per-class parity loop** (`audit.py`): 0 missing methods/funcs/members/files, 25 invented
   methods, 1 missing global (`TSGameRules` singleton `@0x1681a0`), 3 invented globals.

Method notes (see HANDOFF cont.86 §METHODS): DEBUG-LOG-IN-SOURCE (`ALERT`) beat live gdb for OUR build;
live.py on hl.exe/mp.dll works but mp.dll is MSVC so offsets DIFFER from the `.so` (pev@player+4,
CTSStunt@player+0x4dc, fuser1@pev+0x254) — my first trace failed on `.so` offsets. The dossier-subagent hint
(self-contained prompt → decode dossier to `reference/dossiers/`) kept ~330k tokens out of context.

## 2026-07-03 (cont. 84, chunk 5) — ROUND 8: the DEATH CHAPTER complete + fixes batch (session close)

All user-driven, each answered with binary RE (commits c1013a9..2e63e70):
- **DOUBLE-FIRE = FULL-AUTO predicts** (c1013a9): the trigger override existed; the predicted player's
  m_iPowerups was never synced — now rides clientdata iuser4 + a NEW delta.lst clientdata_t entry
  (12 bits; clientdata had NO iuser4 line = the silent-drop trap AGAIN).
- **SUPERJUMP launch ordering** (604ac3d): the lift ARMS only when leaving the ground with duck+jump
  held (m_bSuperJumpArmed); jump-then-duck (the climb motion) stays a normal jump.
- **GLASS PIERCE answered** (already correct): pane count = damage arithmetic — arrived dmg > 5 ->
  step min(2*dmg,48) -> depth-1 continuation carrying dmg x ai->flFactor2 (x0.5 extra through a body);
  pane 2 breaks iff carried dmg >= its health; hard ceiling two surfaces; glass falloff = the caliber
  factor ON TOP of distance (applied again on the second leg).
- **KICKS DECODED** (6d7c1b3/541d0bb, decompile at cont84/kick_ccombatattack.c): bVar9 = 2+movingBack
  (<=100 u/s: IN_BACK; else fwd-dot <= -0.5). STUNT kick (iuser4&0x50c30) move 4 dmg 15 · DUCK-KICK
  (ONGROUND+duck) move 6 dmg 45 + view_ofs(0,0,16)+stunt0x4=2.0 · BACKKICK move 7 dmg speed*0.303
  clamp[15,80] (ours flat 55!) · FRONT KICK (air + speed3D>270 (a running jump clears via z!) + duck +
  fwd>0.5) move 8 (ours sent 0x10 = WRONG anim) dmg speed*0.1538 clamp[15,45] + THE VIEW DIP
  view_ofs=(0,0,16)+timer 2.0. IMPLEMENT the chain rebuild from the file (also retires the FLY-animIdx
  VERIFY). respawntime confirmed correct (user).
- **THE DEATH CHAPTER, complete + user-matched vs the live original**:
  · the respawn gate anchors AT DEATH (6e72139, @0x7ef8c) — the death-cam eats ~2-3 s: first number
    N-2/N-3 (user-measured: 10 -> 8; floor 5 shows 3) · corpse at the TRANSITION not kill time
    (4bed51e, @0x7eaec) · the corpse = the DEAD-PLAYER FX (c6027ba, @0x70234 decompile-exact:
    renderfx 17 + player INDEX in rendercolor.r + renderamt 255 = the fade alpha, rendermode 1, FULL
    velocity, animtime carried, SetSize, EF_NODRAW gate; Spawn @0x7040c = think only) · our stock
    renderer branch read renderamt-as-index and REFUSED it -> reads rendercolor.r first (5304b1e — the
    vanishing-body root cause) · first-person deaths now RENDER the body: the exported CL_IsThirdPerson
    reports third person while dead-not-observer + the view.cpp death-chase branch runs FIRST (cam_ofs
    unmaintained there; 80 back / 24 up = VERIFY vs the original camera RE) + the stock 80-degree dead
    ROLL confined to observers (c6027ba) · the 3.0 s DEATH-CAM LINGER (338518f, decompile-exact: Killed
    arms +0x768 = time+3.0 (const @0xf7f78); deadflag 2->3 staging tick; transition on deadline OR any
    button != IN_SCORE) · the body does NOT mouse-rotate: server pin insufficient (prediction owns the
    local body) -> CLIENT-side latch in StudioDrawPlayer (2e63e70; entity+curstate+latched+gait yaw
    frozen; VERIFY the original's pm mechanism).
- Round-8 items RECORDED for RE: viewmodel anim BLENDING (idle<->fire<->reload snap; the vm analogue of
  the cont.81 blend work) · 3RD-PERSON floating reticle (world-projected aim point, WorldToScreen, lags
  by design) + head-clearing chase cam + the death-cam constants — one camera-RE pass covers all three.
- Scratch captures preserved: reference/dossiers/cont84/scratch/ (subagent batch decodes); client.dis/
  nm_sorted are regenerable (objdump/nm).
## 2026-07-03 (cont. 84, chunk 4) — THE ATTACHMENT SAGA CLOSED (user: "perfect") — rounds 7i..7m

The full silencer/scope system landed through a chain of SIX root causes, each found by evidence
(diagnostics, gdb, xash source), all committed (84d4cbd..c99c278):
1. **tkw type_attach grammar** (84d4cbd): attach rides INSIDE the tkw token (menu -> queue -> BuyWeapon
   (iAttach) -> TakeWeapon); tki = equipment only; akimbo double = extra type_0. + p_ SIL swap
   (pszPlayerModelSil column, Deploy attach&1, both precached) + the silenced-sound flag (iparam2&1,
   vol .84-.92, attn x2 — NOT linked; unsilenced linked = the normal sample).
2. **The viewmodel BODY ships in the weaponanim message** (65a36cc): DefaultDeploy's 5th arg + a CTSGun
   SendWeaponAnim SHADOW carrying GetBodyByItems on every anim (pev->body alone never reaches the vm).
3. **The PREDICTED weapon needs the mask** (54717ea): GetWeaponData packs it.attach into the spare
   m_iWeaponState; SetWeaponData unpacks (the host's predicted anims/events ran attach 0).
4. **delta.lst m_iWeaponState was 2 BITS** (b2b512e): attach 15 -> 3 on the wire (the scope bit died).
   4 bits now + setup-xash-mod.sh SYNCS network/delta.lst (the stale-delta trap, 5d6bb31).
5. **The blink** (80f2ddf): the vm body refreshes EVERY FRAME from prediction (view->curstate.body =
   TS_PredictedViewmodelBody(); the original's DAT_10191d5c mechanism; m61 body-1 quirk kept).
6. **THE ZOOM/SCOPE**: Zoom drives m_iFOV (SetFOV loop — pev->fov via clientdata is OVERRIDDEN by the
   client's own gHUD.m_iFOV report, 01b29fe+5903f39); the prediction gate allows fire while the scope
   hides the vm (narrowed to sub-40 fov after the wholesale removal destabilized, 570837b); EV anims
   guarded on a real vm model — and the SED SELF-CAPTURE hang (fea3cb3): TS_EvWeaponAnim tail-called
   ITSELF (bulk rename rewrote the helper's own inner call; optimizer -> literal infinite loop; caught
   by the user's gdb double-sample at the SAME PC + disasm). test.sh gained GDB=1 attach mode (2ad2f61).
7. **The overlay** (93aa390..c99c278): sprites/quarterscope.spr (referenced by the original client.dll)
   DECODED (arc corner = quarter's BR, palette-index alpha) and pre-composed 4x-mirrored into
   game/ts/sprites/ts_scopefull.spr at build time; drawn SCREEN-SPACE scaled (pfnSPR_DrawGeneric —
   whose blend args xash IGNORES (#if 0): kRenderTransAlpha via TriRenderMode around the draw, 1a680de);
   TS_SCOPE_SCALE 1.45 (user-tuned hole size); full reticle swap + pinned laser dot + side bars; the
   fov-40 threshold drives vm-hide/overlay/reticle as ONE bundle (deagle 60 = bare fov). The world-quad
   TriAPI version was DEPTH-SLICED + sorted under transparent props in xash — screen-space is the way.
   Zoomed beams: flashlight stays, laser beam off, dot pinned (view-aim fallback in GetMuzzleAim).
Round-7 fixes along the way: kill refused while spectating (ClientKill gate; the original only ARMS a
1s delayed-suicide timer — VERIFY the +0x244 gate field + the delay consumer) · press-fire prompt
post-gate on the 1 Hz clock (the sub-second decompile window can't survive tick drift — VERIFY the
original's carrier) · TSActiveItems{idx,0} on StartObserver (dead players' beams off) · stale-anchor
beam gate (no drawn source = no beam) · attachments spawn maximal-ACTIVE (laser/flash ON; AddItem +
pair mirror) · spectate bar = TS-patched STOCK (orange 255,160,0, per-mode #Spec_TSHelp%d help line
rendered — stock builds-and-drops helpString2, no Auto prefix outside HLTV, small font, centred).
TSBUY diagnostics stripped after the confirm. BUILDTYPE=RelWithDebInfo supported for symbolized builds.

NEXT QUEUE: un-zoom hooks (Reload/ShotgunReload/ColdCock/Holster -> Unzoom, dossier §3) + verify the
fov2 second zoom step · the p_ sil THIRD-PERSON confirm + silenced-sound confirm · dossier-invented
remaining folds (SendWeaponStatus->UCD merge, OwnedCount/SlotsUsed->stored counter +0x548, TSSendBuyMenu/
TSCloseMenu/TSSendScoreInfo/IsTeamMode deletes, menuselect dead-swallow, team methods -> stock classes) ·
THE TSGameRules-singleton split (the last missing global) · tasks #7/#8 · the extra events/commands purge.
## 2026-07-03 (cont. 84, chunk 3) — spectate = TS-patched STOCK (user-guided) + dossier-attachments LANDED

- **THE SPECTATE ARCHITECTURE INVERSION (user's question was the key)**: the original KEEPS the stock
  CHudSpectator/SpectatorPanel and RE-SKINS it (#Spec_TSHelp%d/#Spec_Help_TSTitle/TSText tokens, texts in
  ts/titles.txt, help POPUP tokens empty = neutralized). Our parallel TS bar + stock suppression =
  the invention, DELETED (8537452). Deltas applied to stock: NO top border/banner; bottom help line
  rendered (stock BUILDS helpString2 and never draws it — added m_BottomHelpLabel, small non-bold font,
  0b418e0/1dce625); text = HUD ORANGE 255,160,0 (29f4767); '#Spec_Auto' prefix HLTV-only; per-mode help
  token #Spec_TSHelp%d. IsActive() = STOCK g_iUser1 (the wire-latched local state was unreliable during
  connect — the buy-menu-gone bug); Spectator msg only fills the per-player table. User: "flawless".
- **Round 7e (1dce625)**: TSTryRespawn decompile-exact (wait line ONLY when gate<0 = the -4 sentinel;
  silent during countdown; never in plain DM) + m_flSpecMsgTime = the original's +0x754 1 Hz clock (was
  the known unnamed) · TSMessage centre notifications OVERLAP (no line stacking) · countdown 0x10 class
  replaces in place.
- **dossier-attachments.md LANDED** (reference/dossiers/cont84/ + 19 att_*.c) — THE map for the next
  implementation wave: (1) p_ SIL SWAP: new wi+0x1b2 pszPlayerModelSil (16 literal p_X_sil names;
  mp5sd/ruger dup normal; mac10->p_ump_sil), Deploy @0x71030 picks it iff attach&1, TSPrecache both;
  (1b) FIRE-SOUND FLAG CORRECTION: silenced = iparam2&1 (NOT linked — fixes the user's akimbo-sil
  report): wi+0x306 at vol .84-.92 attn x2; linked unsilenced = the NORMAL sample; (2) BUY GRAMMAR:
  attach rides INSIDE tkw as type_attach (tki = items only; akimbo double = extra type_0; stackables
  type_count); in-memory last-config (no file — live-dir verified); (3) RIGHT-CLICK TREE: attach&8 ->
  zoom cycle 0->fov1->fov2->0 + Unzoom hooks in Reload/ShotgunReload/ColdCock/Holster; no scope ->
  hold/tilt = anim block[7] + block-pointer swap 0x252<->0x28c; (4) GUN-ANCHOR CACHE: per-frame in
  HUD_DrawTransparentTriangles copy each player ent->attachment[0..3] (PLAYER.mdl atts: 0/1/3 collinear
  right-gun bone, 2 = left; p_ models have ZERO; my 0-attachment read was a WRONG OFFSET — 212/216 is
  right) -> fixes the PELVIS FLARE + brass; (5) LASER: remote dir = smoothed normalize(cacheAtt1-att0)
  (v_ models carry collinear att pairs too — dir rotates with the gun bone = the reload sweep), start
  origin+stance-z, color from PlInfo (1 green/2 blue/else red 255,25,25); local = vm att0 along
  att1-att0 (+att2/3 second akimbo beam); (6) draw.sc mask = BODY only (the +0x178 anim-offset prior
  finding was a misread). WeaponInfo byte4 = fireMode, byte5 attach = HUD-only. ActItems stores a byte,
  nothing else. NEXT: implement 4+5 (pelvis flare + laser) first, then 1/1b, then 2, then 3.
## 2026-07-03 (cont. 84, chunk 2) — round-7 folds + the Spectator wire + the attachment RE opened

- **Round 7 results folded**: dry-click/brass/pump/linked/FOV/HUD/glass PASS. Fixes: the third-person
  muzzle FLARE anchored to the frozen viewmodel (5e663cd; now player model when thirdperson) — but
  round 7b shows it at the PELVIS: player attachment[] is UNFILLED because **TS player models AND p_
  models have ZERO attachments** (struct-read proven) — the original anchors gun effects (flare, brass,
  LASER + its direction) via a per-frame BONE cache (client DAT_1018caf8, FUN_10056be0) its renderer
  fills. **p_<gun>_sil.mdl variants exist and BOTH binaries carry the strings — the silencer on other
  players = a whole p_-model swap (server-side pev->weaponmodel pick).** Linked-bang "pitch" question
  answered: NO pitch difference (vol .84-.92 + attn x2 only; protocol text was wrong, code was right).
- **CTSGun::AddItem completed** (5e663cd, @0x70794 decompile): akimbo-pair attach MIRRORING + the
  reselect/DEPLOY refresh tail (the viewmodel body never updated before); the invented bought-laser-
  starts-active grant removed. **Buys apply at NEXT SPAWN in the original** (BuyArmament's only caller
  = PlayerSpawn @0x790ac; tkw/tki/tka handlers queue-only via AddItemToArmament @0x83ea4).
- **dossier-invented.md LANDED** (subagent, reference/dossiers/cont84/ + inv_*.c): verdicts for all 28
  invented methods (summary table in the dossier): GetWeaponData -> the FREE @0xa00ac (fuser2/3-barrel-
  clips REFUTED — but ours is a working prediction divergence, hold); SendWeaponStatus -> CTSGun::UCD
  @0x758c8; OwnedCount/SlotsUsed -> DELETE (TSSpace = stored counter +0x548); TS spectate trio -> Start/
  StopObserver + the PreThink iuser1-block + the "respawn" cmd; TSSendBuyMenu/TSCloseMenu/TSSendScoreInfo/
  IsTeamMode -> DELETE; menuselect = a dead swallow in gamerules ClientCommand; PlayerKilled/PlayerSpawn/
  team methods -> the STOCK CHalfLifeMultiplay/Teamplay (TS-patched) — **the original runs stock
  g_pGameRules + a SEPARATE non-virtual TSGameRules singleton** (the missing global @0x1681a0).
- **The Spectator wire FOLDED (55f85a0)**: (idx,flag) broadcasts at all senders (TSEnterSpectate/
  StopObserver/TSInit/ForceClientDllUpdate); countdown/"Press Fire To Play!" moved onto 1 Hz
  TSHudMessageOne lines (decompile-exact @0x81458); hold-window expiry corrected (gate -4.0f, award 1,
  red line + CallCheckDeads — V11 closed); client parses (idx,flag) + sends "respawn" on +attack
  (0.2 s ratelimit, menu-closed gated) = the original fire-to-play. PLAYTEST: the whole join loop.
- **dossier-attachments subagent RUNNING** (background): the p_ _sil swap rule, the buy/apply grammar
  (original client FUN_10039400 + live cfg files), SecondaryAttack's full right-click tree (scope vs
  hold vs deagle tilt), the bone/gun-anchor cache writer + the laser beam source/direction, WeaponInfo
  attachFlags + ActItems consumers, draw-anim offsets by active mask.

## 2026-07-03 (cont. 84) — invented review opened: gmsg central registration + wire fixes + door-helper respawn

Continued `restructure-source-parity` (NOT merged; GPG off). Commits `3f7ff03..06c1075`, all build-green
(amd64 all) + nm-T-gated (baseline regenerated once for the INTENDED CBaseDoor::RespawnThink export removal).
Headline: **32 -> 28 invented methods · 6 -> 1 missing globals (TSGameRules instance only) · server cvars
0 missing · 0 everything-else**.

- **Central LinkUserMessages (3f7ff03)** — ALL user messages now register in LinkUserMessages in the
  original's exact 64-slot order (star_LinkUserMessages.md @0xc7db0); every lazy first-use REG site
  stripped (12 files; ts_powerup's duplicate s_gmsgPwUp gone; gmsg statics globalized to match the
  original's D symbols). Message IDs now assign in the original's order. The impulse-99 Logo lazy reg
  KEPT (the original keeps it lazy too — gmsgLogo absent from the block, reloc-proven). TWO WIRE BUGS:
  "TSFrags" (not "TSCreateDebris" — server reg + client hook renamed) and "TSHVoice" (not
  "TSVoiceMessage"); gmsgTSVoiceMessage moved to TS_gamerulesclass.cpp (the original's home).
  gmsgFlashlight/gmsgFlashBattery/gmsgSetCurWeap = DEAD globals added (reloc-proven never referenced;
  the HANDOFF's "the original registers them" was WRONG). teamlist default -> "hitman;gordon".
  coverage.py client-hook scan fixed (raw pfnHookUserMsg) — REAL missing client hooks = 8:
  NextStunt/Objective/ShowObj/TSFlag/TSFrags/TSHVoice/TSMBlur/TSPSys (deferred client-HUD features).
- **cvar_t symbol parity (b243d56)** — ts_cvars.cpp structs renamed to the original's globals (defaults
  verified @0x108d80..0x109028): + teammodels("mp_teammodels")/dmcashbased("usecash")/
  cv_ammocount("ammocount")/weaponstay_time("weaponstay"). "deadstomach" cvar DELETED (false positive:
  a CDeadHEV pose-string pair read as a cvar_t). audit.py excludes 'objects' (libgcc frame.c CRT).
  coverage.py: pose-alias exclusion + game_shared scan (sv_alltalk/voice_serverdebug). 
- **Door respawn = the info_breakable helper (de8a071)** — CBaseDoor::RespawnThink DELETED; decompiles
  (dossiers/cont84/door_respawn_decomp.c): door Spawn @0xb60cc creates the helper into door+0x104
  (back-linked helper+0x64), death @0xb57ac tail + both blocked-retry legs arm the HELPER's think;
  CInfoBreakable::RespawnThink dispatches BreakableRespawn VIRTUALLY (@0x65da0 vtbl slot +8).
  Exact-store corrections: effects = EF_NODRAW / = 0 (not |=/&=~), box-check maxCount 1, NO
  SUB_UseTargets on shatter (ours was invented). CTSGun::SwitchBarrel DELETED (uncalled; the invented
  barrel-cycle). VERIFY carried: the door's TSFrags payload sends ZEROS for dir/model/velmag (ours
  sends real dir + glassfrag + 150) — client-handler RE needed before mimicking.
- **stock_methods.py header-inline scan (06c1075)** — the .cpp-only scan missed class-body definitions;
  MyTogglePointer + CallDoRetireWeapon auto-classify stock (verbatim upstream). 3621 pairs.
- **Dossier subagent LAUNCHED** (background): reference/dossiers/cont84/dossier-invented.md — homes for
  the remaining 28 invented methods (free GetWeaponData @0xa00ac = the true weapon_data packer!,
  CTSGun::UpdateClientData @0x758c8, the spectate/menu/ScoreInfo/RoundTime senders, the CTSGameRules
  team machinery, draw.sc iparam2 + "Spectator" wire verdicts). Do NOT run re.sh while it holds the
  re project.

REMAINING (task order): fold round-7 playtest results in (protocol handed to the user: dry-click/brass/
pump/linked/silenced/spawn-protection/telefrag/PseudoClimb/kill-feed/respawn-floor + NEW door-respawn +
TSFrags shatter regression + all-HUD smoke after the registration consolidation) · the subagent's verdicts
-> MOVE/ACCEPT/DELETE each remaining invented method · TSGameRules-the-instance @0x1681a0 (plan) ·
g_TSGun/g_tsActive/g_tsPool · 19 extra events + 16 extra server commands + stock weapon sources purge ·
the Spectator wire reconcile.

## 2026-07-02 (cont. 83) — ZERO missing methods + ZERO missing free funcs (the 6+6 queue cleared)

Continued `restructure-source-parity` (NOT merged; GPG off). Every commit build-green (`build.sh amd64 all`)
+ nm-T-gated. Headline moved **6 -> 0 missing methods · 33 -> 32 invented · 6 -> 0 missing free funcs**.
Commits `f67c6eb..75d9289`:

### The 6 missing methods (all landed)
- **The gun FRAME MACHINE (f67c6eb)** — the three CTSGun methods were hiding the whole per-frame shape:
  the original's driver is the REWRITTEN BASE `CBasePlayerWeapon::ItemPostFrame` (@0x903d4, m_iId==0x10
  gate) — ours moved into weapons_shared.cpp, CTSGun::ItemPostFrame DELETED. EmptySound @0x71be4 (contender
  silent; empty.sc; ±0.1/idle 0.5) · StopReload @0x71288 (ColdCock+MultiplyClips callers; the pump machine
  NEVER arms item+0xc) · ReloadWeapon @0x74a14 (arm-only; player m_flNextAttack = the clock; refill in the
  base ItemPostFrame w/ akimbo pair mirroring). Reload @0x74d5c decompile-exact (blades->CCombatBlock,
  sawed-off shell-retained anim block[8], reload.sc iparam1=type iparam2=attach fparam1=0, idle+5, Unzoom);
  ShotgunReload @0x74aac (phase machine in item+0x8; reload.sc fparam1 8/9/10; insert period = wi+0x14;
  driver = WeaponIdle->Reload); WeaponIdle @0x754dc (every frame: pump continuation, the BURST machine on
  the primary timer, idle-tick = grenade cook / AUTO-RELOAD dry / stance idle anim); Fire @0x71c78
  (waterlevel-3 click, InfiniteClips gate, akimbo 3rd-person 8+side vs pump TSA_FIRE — we had it INVERTED);
  MultiplyClips @0x71308 (m61 refused; the MISSING STACKABLE branch — knives add units funded by free
  slots; SlotsUsed now charges per-unit); ColdCock alignment (GrenadeIdle(1)+StopReload, all four timers
  +0.725, idle+2, kevlarhit CHAN_BODY attn .8). **+alt2 is the IN_CANCEL BUTTON (0x40)** — the original
  server has NO ±alt2 command (ours removed; client sets in_cancel; the new m_flNextAlternateAttack
  gun+0xa4 is predicted via fuser4 + both decrement loops). Member merges: m_burstCount+m_shotgunPhase ->
  m_burstOrPhase (ONE item+0x8 slot: burst/pump-phase/cook); m_akimboSide -> m_fInSpecialReload (the ONE
  pumpToggle byte, PARKED per item — holster clears reloading+phase but NOT it). Data columns extracted
  (dossier cont83/animblocks.md): flReloadTime(+0x14) all 38, iStackable(+0xdc = knife/seal/m61),
  hold-idle block[0](+0x28c), shell-retained block[8](+0x262/0x29c), and **the COLDCOCK block[28] column —
  the gun-event tail is now UNBLOCKED on data**. STAND-INS kept + documented: predicted reload/pump
  SendWeaponAnims, insert-shell.wav, 357_cock1 click, coldcock miss whoosh (until the ev handlers land).
- **ShootBulletsPlayer (TS_combat.cpp, its own original TU)** — TSFireBulletsPenetrate WAS the original
  under an invented name. Corrections forced by the decompile: POLAR cubic spread (not gaussian);
  ONE MultiDamage batch per volley; pierce = DEPTH-1 recursion (iMode 2, /30 falloff leg) not an 8-layer
  loop; damagemult is CHEAT-GATED global (not per-layer decay — the real decay = ai->flFactor2 (+0x18
  consumer FOUND) x0.5 through a body); rbullet gate includes REALBULLET; BubbleTrail per pellet.
  Signature: (uchar cShots, src, dir, spread, float dmg, iMode=wi->iKnifeType, iCaliber, seed) -> Vector.
- **TSInit (first call in Spawn @0x7f586)** — absorbed the Spawn-top inline block + surfaced SPAWN
  PROTECTION (1s: +0x71c deadline == m_flDisarmTime, renderfx Distort shimmer, (200,200,250) fade;
  PreThink clears @0x81458; TraceAttack's refusal @0x801eb = VERIFY) + the map-global SUPERJUMP
  (rules+0x5885 = new m_bSrvSuperJump <- ts_mapglobals SF&0x40; "mj" physinfo) + the client caches init
  0xff (FORCE the first TSState/TSBTime/TSPAward sends) + The-One rules-flag clear. Our "Spectator" wire
  flagged INVENTED (the original broadcasts (idx,0) stock-style; ours carries state+seconds).
- **PickUpWeapon @0x8314c** — ALL FIVE call sites decoded (worldgun/groundweapon: bSelect = type!=FLAG;
  knife Use: NO SWITCH; buy: the sole bRecordOwner -> TSItem::hOwner item+0x30; powerup/give m61: select).
  THE KNIFE-STACK MERGE (the S8 gap): owned stackable ADDS units (slot-charged per unit). TakeWeapon
  reshaped (type, status, clip; auto-wield REMOVED — PickUpWeapon's bSelect owns it; world pickups restore
  the FULL parked status). TSPickUpWeapon deleted.

### The 6 missing free funcs (all landed)
- **SetPlayerRespawnTime @0x65ff4** — the respawn funnel; m_flSpawnGateTime MERGED into m_flTSRespawnTime
  (ONE +0x770 carrier; negative = locked out). New: m_iRespawnsUsed (+0x7ba, Killed++ , InitHUD/RestartRound
  reset) + m_flRespawnHoldTime (+0x7bc LMS re-entry hold; PreThink expiry -> gate -1 + award 1; V11 = the
  countdown HUD msg untranscribed). Caller clamp = round(clamp(respawntime,5,30)) — the original FLOOR IS 5
  (ours was 3; default cvar 3 -> real wait 5s, PLAYTEST note). The TSPAward 1/11 producers complete.
- **RemoveEntityFromSlowedArray @0x8fb4c** — the packed slowed-projectile array (RAW ptrs m_pSlowedEnts[32]
  +0x208 / count +0x288, HOLES KEPT) + all EIGHT scrub sites (shrapnel/m61/knife x2/flag/worldgun x3).
  Empty until the projectile-GoSlow feature populates it.
- **TSPlayerDisconnect @0x8f94c** — ClientDisconnected's TS hook: vote-block clear (the vote-rejoin bug),
  edict park (FL_DORMANT/EF_NODRAW/...), gate -4, The-One clear, CallCheckDeads (a leave can end a round).
- **PseudoClimb @0xe8fc8** — the hold-jump wall scramble, TSHandle HEAD (IN_JUMP && onground==-1, BEFORE
  the STOP damp). Both libs (predicted). PLAYTEST: crate scramble / look-up probe raise / half-maxspeed cut.
- **TSGetPointsForFrag @0x79140** — the stylish-kill scorer wired into PlayerKilled (frags += ...): The-One
  gate, kung-fu 2 ("#TS_KungFu"), thrown-blade 2 (GetDescription), stunt/slide +1, the green feed line.
  **glast_weaponid** lands (ts_bullet.cpp, init -1 — V21 RESOLVED); the bullet record captures the firing
  weapon at fire time (rec+0x30), UpdateBullet publishes on hit. VERIFY: PlayerKilled's kill-TIER tail
  (@0x7a908.. m_iAward 2/3/4 + a slow-mo reward grant off the out-bools/DoSpectacularNess) needs typed RE.
- **TSSelectSpawnSpot @0x66244** + EntSelectSpawnPoint REPLACED with the original's 4-call body: the
  teammate-cover band (0x1801-0x2000) / unseen band (0x1001-0x1800) / nearest-distance scorer + the
  crowded-winner 128u TELEFRAG (300 NEVERGIB) + fallbacks + g_pLastSpawn. PLAYTEST-GATED (spawn feel).

AUDIT: **0 missing/0 invented classes · 0 missing methods · 32 invented methods · 0 missing members ·
0 missing free funcs · 0 file mismatches · 6 missing globals (TSGameRules/gmsgFlashBattery/gmsgFlashlight/
gmsgSetCurWeap/objects/roundtime) · 3 invented globals (g_TSGun/g_tsActive/g_tsPool)**.

### Playtest round 3 (user PASS on rounds 1-2 + the cont.83 surface; 2 fixes, 021864a)
- Settled thrown blades get the white PICKUPABLE glow shell — KATANA excluded (KungFu-gated
  recovery). Same user-directed live-original divergence class as the dropped-gun glow (no render
  writes in either binary's knife code). Applied at the BounceTouch settle tail.
- Coldcock had no FIRST-person anim (m4): block[28] column added to the table (iColdCockAnim/
  +hold, the 11 coldcock guns) + a PREDICTED SendWeaponAnim stand-in in ColdCock until the
  coldcock.sc ev swap (task #5) replaces it.

### Playtest round 4 (coldcock silent + no fire-torso while moving; 3 fixes + the coldcock/closecombat event swaps)
- **THE ITALIAN-BONE GAIT SPLIT** — the root cause of "no fire anim while moving, any state": TS player
  skeletons name the spine "Bip01 Dorso" / pelvis "Bip01 Bacino"; the stock client gait split keys on
  "Bip01 Spine" -> matched nothing -> the gait owned the whole skeleton -> no upper-body composites while
  moving. The ORIGINAL client.dll ships BOTH strings (definitive). StudioModelRenderer now stops at either.
- Coldcock went silent post-swap: the playback gated on item->owned (server-only) — the predicted host
  event vanished under FEV_NOTHOST. SetWeaponData marks the wielded item owned client-side.
- The directional slide-fire (slide_<l/r/f/b>_<grip>_shoot) re-enabled — the "dead code +0x51c" note was
  wrong (+0x51c = m_bDirForward, cont.81); mirrors the TSA_SLIDE direction selection per @case 0/8/9.
- coldcock.sc + closecombat.sc SWAPPED both sides (server gun+0x966/0x96c + EV_TSColdCock/EV_TSCloseCombat
  per dossier-ev-melee §4/§5); CCombatBlock decompile-exact (four-timer gate, iparam2 1 bare/0x12 armed);
  CCombatAttack's per-move (move,animIdx) pairs disasm-slot-tracked (the 3-jab vm cycling was invented —
  the original sends anim 3 for every punch; the FLY family's animIdx is a VERIFY). The FULL 29-short
  anim blocks (both stances, all 38 weapons) landed in s_weapon_info (movl-PAIR-aware extraction).
- The five-handler gun-tail dossier (subagent) at cont83/dossier-ev-guntail.md: reload.sc fparam1 IS the
  anim-block index; empty.sc = weapons/pistol-empty.wav universal; pump.sc anim block[13+rand(0,1)] +
  the wi+0x306 rack sound at ent-1 CHAN_WEAPON (the no-cutoff trick); grenade.sc = our path already right;
  firelinked.sc bparam1=barrel bparam2=SEED (collides with our akimbo bparam2 extension!). Wiring = next.

### Playtest round 5 (the ammo-economy mismatch, user-caught: m16 18/58 vs original 18/120; bef399c)
- TakeWeapon @0x70a04 grants NO reserve (our iClip*3 was invented); its 3rd arg = the ATTACHMENT
  MASK (BuyWeapon @0x845bc prices silencer 900/laser 800/flash 500/scope 1800 and passes the bits;
  the PickUpWeapon reshape had mislabeled it iClip). Fresh attach = mask|builtin & supported,
  laser/flash start active; akimbo combine unions attach/active both slots; a single REFUSES while
  its akimbo is owned. STACK MODEL: iPellets(+0x24) = the CARRY CAP (knife 5/seal 10/m61 2); the
  merge is +1 per take, cap-gated; the knife/seal table clips reverted to Write_ truth (iClip=1) —
  the old x5/x10 overrides compensated for BuyArmament ignoring the queued count (now loops
  BuyWeapon per unit; 2 identical pistols combine into the akimbo through the same path).
- BuyAmmo @0x841e8 = FILL TO CAP one mag at a time (per-mag charge when cash; free -> iMaxCarry =
  the 120); -2 = every owned caliber. Ground weapon tops only an EMPTY reserve (@0x925ec).
- Sparta cross-checked: only spread/viewkick/recoil/damage — clips/caps are Write_-stage truth.

### The gun-event tail COMPLETE (6b8815b) — 12/12 TS events wired, 0 missing
All five remaining handlers landed from the subagent dossier (cont83/dossier-ev-guntail.md):
empty (pistol-empty.wav universal — 357_cock1 was wrong) · reload (fparam1 IS the block index;
phase-9 shuck everyone, phase-10 wi+0x306 non-local, phase-0 generic_reload + brass/mag toss
non-local; the sawed-off block[8] is a LEFTOVER — the original sends fparam1=0 too) · pump
(server sender gun+0x96a; anim block[13/14] client-random; rack = wi+0x306 at ENT -1 — the
no-channel-cut trick; MOSSBERG RACK IS m3-pump.wav, scock was wrong) · grenade (in-eye-spec-only
anim; our predicted local half correct) · firelinked (server sender gun+0x96e; both flares/two
casings/skorpion gentle brass/ONE wi+0x306 bang .84-.92 attn x2; AkimboFire splits both->linked,
single->fire.sc bparam1=barrel; bparam2 = the FireBullets SEED everywhere — the old side
extension collided). New columns (adjudicated): pszAltSound(+0x306 triple-duty), pszShellModel
(+0xe8), iShellSetback(+0x34c). All server presentation stand-ins retired. 19 extra events =
stock-HL leftovers (invented-review scope). NEW VERIFYs: the FLY-family closecombat animIdx
(register-carried) · gold/skorpion_akimbo's EMPTY wi+0x306 in the linked bang (our fallback =
the normal fire) · the phase-0 brass recipes' exact R_TempModel arg mapping.

### Playtest round 6 (2e512ec) — the AKIMBO trigger/barrel model (user-specified) + default_fov 80
The user's model, implemented: plain AUTO = both barrels AT ONCE (uzis); plain SEMI = alternate
per pull; the FREE modes (4 "Free Semi"/5 "Free Full") = LEFT CLICK -> LEFT barrel, RIGHT CLICK ->
RIGHT (item+0x24 carries the clicked barrel), semi per-press / full while-held, EACH BARREL DRAINS
ITS OWN CLIP + dry-clicks when THAT barrel empties. Plain-mode akimbo right-click = the HOLD toggle
(guns facing each other; v_berettas change/rechange 14/15 + v_mk23_akimbo 11/12 added to kHold).
Akimbo vm anims moved onto the events (EV_TSFire block[22..25] off bparam1; linked [3..5]);
AkimboFire's SendWeaponAnim retired; the right trigger shares the cadence. default_fov -> 80 +
the two stock 90-floor clamps removed (hud_redraw).

### SESSION CLOSE (cont.83)
- Working set preserved at reference/dossiers/cont83/ (8 server decompiles + the guntail client
  dossier + animblocks + a README indexing every technique incl. the movl-pair and model-dump
  recipes and the two guntail label corrections). HANDOFF cont.84 rewritten end-of-session
  (queue = the invented review #6 with the full disposition work-list, the stunt/pm tail #7,
  the VERIFY batch #8, the round-7 playtest surface). Audit at close: 0 missing methods/free
  funcs/members/files · 32 invented methods · 6 missing + 3 invented globals · 12/12 events.

### Round 6e (e2cfb1b) — the flare-vanished inversion, akimbo saga CLOSED (user: "perfect")
6d deferred the local akimbo flash to the models' 5001-family events — but those trigger
R_MuzzleFlash (the FAINT engine flash), not the bright flare: it vanished. Inverted like the
original: the fire events ALWAYS draw the explicit flare at the fired barrel; HUD_StudioEvent
suppresses the 5001/5011/5021/5031 engine doubles (iMuzzleFlash=false).

### Playtest round 6c/6d + the VERIFY RE (5397c2c, 0306b68, 1770cf1)
- The akimbo per-barrel ANIM sides were swapped (the guntail dossier's labels wrong; the MODELS
  settle it: block[22/23]=rightshoot, [24/25]=leftshoot) — bparam1 1 -> [24/25].
- The muzzle-sprite doubling: the akimbo viewmodels EMBED their per-gun flashes as sequence
  events (5001/5011 rightshoot, 5021/5031 leftshoot) which HUD_StudioEvent renders — our flare
  drew a second sprite at attachment[1] (still a right-gun attachment). Local akimbo singles now
  defer to the model events; side->attachment mapping fixed (left=2); linked keeps both explicit
  flares (linkedshoot carries NO events — verified).
- 6b: the REAL barrel clips now ride weapon_data fuser2/3 (the balanced SetWeaponData
  reconstruction fed prediction half-full barrels: infinite free-fire, no dry-click, stuck flare).
- THE VERIFY RE (AkimboFire @0x729c0 + StandardFire @0x724a4 re-read): the user's model CONFIRMED
  + 5 corrections folded: both-buttons-in-free-mode = a LINKED shot (mode 5 held / mode 4 the
  pressed cache +0x814); **ScaleSpread's 4th arg = the SILENCED flag** (not ducking — mislabeled;
  sil tightens x0.875 base / x0.775 growth); recoil increment x5 when MOVING > 175 u/s + x2 on a
  linked shot; the akimbos run ScaleSpread at all; a non-integral SILENCER costs x0.775 damage;
  the ft-4 akimbo mirrors a barrel into its single's parked clip after every shot.

NEW VERIFY items this session: TraceAttack spawn-grace refusal (@0x801eb) + the 0x10c10 stunt dmg mult ·
PlayerKilled kill-tier/slow-mo-reward tail · the "Spectator" wire (ours state+seconds vs original idx+flag) ·
TSItem::hOwner consumer (sell-zone?) · the V11 LMS countdown HUD · ResetRestartRound still reads the dead
"lms" cvar (TS_gamerulesclass.cpp:~425) · burstOrPhase/pump prediction packing (not in weapon_data).

## 2026-07-02 (cont. 82) — melee S7a/b/c + S8 + HolsterWeapon + S10 applied (the blade split, both sides)

Continued `restructure-source-parity` (NOT merged; GPG off). Applied the rest of the cont.81 melee dossier
centrally, every commit build-green (`build.sh amd64 all`) + nm-T-gated. Headline moved **13 → 8 missing
methods · 41 → 33 invented · CTSKnife 9/9 · CTSGun 42/47**. Commits `d80d29a..`:

- **S7a (d80d29a)**: `CTSGun::SecondaryAttack` extracted decompile-exact (@0x717a8, fresh dc.sh decompile —
  scratch secondaryattack.c): grenade/knife write item+0x24 (new `TSItem.altMode`) then share the primary
  fire fn; katana → new `KatanaThrow` (@0x73b68 verbatim: 32u wall-clipped eye trace, 1000 u/s, roll 90 /
  spin -700, TSA_CC_KNIFELAUNCH gated, katana/miss.wav 95+rand31, !InfiniteClips → DropWeapon + speed);
  fire-type 11 no-op; **akimbo modes 4/5 route right-click to Fire() (the other hand) — replaced our
  invented SwitchBarrel right-click**; scope-vs-hold branch on attach&8; **timer tail fixed to the
  original's secondary +0.3 / idle +1.0** (ours had primary+0.3/secondary+1.0 swapped); DELETED the
  invented kungfu-powerup armed-kick fallback (not in the original — where the original grants it is a
  task-#5 question). CreateKnife/TSThrowKnife contract → `(player, pos, vel, knifeType 6/7/8)`, damage
  stays inside CTSKnife, orientation moved to the THROWERS. PLAYTEST-GATED: akimbo right-click now fires.
- **S8 + S7b server (a941f0b)**: CTSKnife re-transcribed from a fresh BounceTouch decompile — **the old
  settle machinery was materially wrong**: in-flight (+0x90) clears on any sub-700 u/s touch; katana flag
  (+0x91) re-derived EVERY touch; worldspawn EMBED = SOLID_NOT + **MOVETYPE_FLY** + back-off 6 + roll 90
  for BOTH fast head-on AND slow (<100) touches; fast+glancing deflects with NO settle; all blades use the
  knife_* wavs; the common tail installs **WaitTouch** (@0x6dce8 verbatim: ONGROUND ×0.5 damp, <32 →
  flat+stop) + WaitThink + gravity .75 + expire +10 (settled knife lives ~10 s, NO glow). Use @0x6dda4
  exact gates: in-flight refusal, **katana +USE only for KungFu() players** (L13 — playtest flag: binary
  unambiguous, user recollection said otherwise), expired → silent remove, failed pickup keeps the knife
  (TSPickUpWeapon now returns success). DELETED StartSettle/SettleThink/BecomePickup/PickupTouch/StickAt/
  Classify. + `KatanaFire` server (@0x733f0): the 5-stance table (stunt/back -75/duck/normal-alternating/
  air speed-scaled), signed-damage reverse CheckHull, VictimKatanaHold, bloody blade (item+0x8+pev->body),
  whiff-lunge, STOP root, **katana.sc every swing** (FEV_NOTHOST, iparam1=vmAnim 15/16/17, iparam2=bloody).
- **S7b client (4fb5a39)**: a fresh subagent RE'd ALL FIVE client.dll melee/draw handlers →
  `reference/dossiers/cont81/dossier-ev-melee.md` (+ev_*.c). Key contract: melee pitch = **25 +
  75*timescale + rand(-5,5)** (bullet-time scaled), vol RandomFloat(.92,1), anim = the **wi+0x252
  short block** (draw [2], swings [15..17], coldcock [28]; hold twin +0x28c; closecombat.sc iparam2 =
  raw block index, fparam1 = weaponType float; draw.sc anim = in-eye spectators ONLY). Implemented
  `EV_TSKatana` (LAB_10044230 faithful: id-15 traces 55 BEHIND, miss/miss1 50/50, texture-note classifier,
  12 glints, flesh silent + forces bloody, anim remapped via the block) + the shared kit
  (TS_MeleeSoundPitch/Volume, TS_MeleePlayTextureSound = FUN_10045df0 clone, TS_InEyeSpectating).
  **iSwingAnims[3] recovered from the Write_* disasm** (knife 3/4/5 · seal 2/3/4 · katana 4/3/2).
- **S7c (f1d69c4)**: `KnifeFire` @0x74044 — slash+throw on altMode; MeleeAttack/ThrowKnife/m_slashStep
  DELETED. Slash: CheckHull hull-3 @35u (was a 48/64 point trace), **DMG_SLASH|NEVERGIB 0x1004** (was
  CLUB), props take NO slash damage, VictimKnifeHold gate, bloody state, victim-edict hitbody, whiff-arm;
  **knife.sc now plays EVERY slash (FEV_NOTHOST, iparam1=weaponType, iparam2=bloody)** — the old
  surface-hit-only+coords wire was original-client-incompatible. Throw: wall-clipped spawn, consume
  !InfiniteClips, DropWeapon at 0, model-derived redraw + draw.sc + idle 2.0. Client `EV_TSKnife`
  (LAB_10043c90 faithful; client picks the swing RandomLong(0,2)); per-swing view shake kept on both.
- **S7-fold (7bf4d68)**: `HolsterWeapon` @0x85698 extracted from SelectWeapon — holster TO BARE HANDS
  (whiff-clear-on-switch, m_flNextAttack +0.5 = player+0x12c, anim-override clear, kungfu viewmodel +
  draw.sc(0) on every switch, combo resets). GrenadeIdle(1) put-away noted (method still missing).
- **S10**: stock-HL client event hooks DELETED from Game_HookEvents (registration parity; the 19 REPORT
  "extra events" remain as binary strings until the stock weapon sources leave the client build — #5).
  members_re.tsv += CTSKnife 0x88/0x90/0x91/0xa0. coverage.py: katana.sc/knife.sc matched; events still
  missing = closecombat/coldcock/empty/firelinked/grenade/pump (the gun-event tail + the S5/S6-deferred
  closecombat.sc/coldcock.sc swaps — the anim-block data for GUNS (block[28] etc.) needs a bulk Write_*
  extraction pass first).

REMAINING melee tail: the closecombat.sc/coldcock.sc event swaps (client handlers fully RE'd in
dossier-ev-melee.md; needs per-gun block[28] extraction) · CTSGun missing: EmptySound, GrenadeIdle,
ReloadWeapon, StopReload (+CBasePlayer CheckForWires/PickUpWeapon/ShootBulletsPlayer/TSInit).

### gmsg U-units applied (cont.82 continued; commits b57fe1c..9cd2a5d)
- **U0 (b57fe1c)** registration-set parity: SelAmmo(4) FIRST + the linked guard; ClipInfo(1) registered
  (+ client CHudTSWeaponBar::MsgFunc_ClipInfo); DELETED StatusText/StatusValue (UpdateStatusBar neutered),
  Weapons (HLU 64-bit weapon bits — PLAYTEST-GATED; client hook+MsgFunc gone, m_iWeaponBits stays 0),
  Flashlight/FlashBat (regs+sends+client hooks; battery logic kept wire-less); gmsgTSKickAlign dead-global
  parity. Coverage extras 8→5.
- **U1 (96a7e68)** TSState (0x498/0x499, posture wire now drives the client figure — g_iTSProne + usehull
  derivation DELETED) · TSSpace (free slots recompute) · TSBTime (m_bSlowBullets IS the 0x175 byte —
  star-settled; client g_bBulletTime now feeds TS_AddViewRecoil's bullet-time reduction, closing that VERIFY).
- **U1d (8be3cda)** TSPAward: m_iAward 0x74c + 0x74d cache, MSG_ALL entindex+byte on-change; producers wired
  where hosts exist (spawn clear, The One=10, RestartRound=11, Killed=11); out-of-round 1 + kill tiers 2/3/4
  await SetPlayerRespawnTime/PlayerKilled-tier passes. Client per-player g_iTSPlayerAward[] table.
- **U2 (693c5c5)** PlInfo: client announces cl_lasercolor changes via the lasclr_<n> PREFIX server cmd;
  server rebroadcasts MSG_ALL (idx, 0, raw byte); client colors OTHER players' lasers from it (default-red
  SLICE closed). PLAYTEST: two-client laser colors.
- **U4a (9cd2a5d)** PTakeDam(13) disasm-verbatim: TraceAttack throttled (0.3s, +0x750) MSG_PVS hit point +
  dir + encoded byte (dmg*0.5, x8 under bit25, cap 127, +128 upper body); stock Damage stays REGISTERED but
  its send is REMOVED (original never sends); client CHudHealth hooks PTakeDam (Damage hook kept) → pain
  direction. VERIFY tail: client FUN_10048840 bit7 decode/hit effect.
- **PENDING gmsg**: U3 SrvSett (star-SETTLED: id0=realbullet cache 0x578, id1=dmcashbased/usecash bool,
  id2=ammocount + Set_ammo_count BEFORE the MSG_ALL send, id3=weaponrestriction bitmask 0x5870&0x586c;
  InitHUD sends ALL FOUR MSG_ONE; **Set_ammo_count now EXISTS (F2a) — U3 is unblocked**) · U3b Wires (needs
  CBasePlayer::CheckForWires) · U4b TSFade (decompile UTIL_ScreenFadeWrite @0xdcc54 first) · U5 CustomWP
  (needs iPrice extraction + the TS_util SendWeaponParams family — F2b).

### SESSION CLOSE (cont.82): playtest round-2 fixes + handoff
- **m61 type-code fix (6f42cfd)**: the grenade never spawned — iKnifeType[TSW_M61]=4 was never populated
  (the GrenadeIdle throw gate is `info+0x20 == 4`, Write_m61 @0x77e0e).
- **Round 2 (e80cb34)**: drop glow on ALL guns (BOTH binaries gate it to the briefcase @0x90902/mp.dll
  @0x742a6 — user-directed divergence, documented at the site); explo boom pitched 100+300*slow (recorded-
  slow wav); blast glass shards scale with the killing damage (the exact CBreakable+0x110 factor VERIFY);
  **the breakable-respawn DEFAULT bug** — gcc2 calloc'd entity data means an absent `respawntime` keyvalue
  = 0 = the 30s default in the original; our -1 defaults (func_break + doors) made everything permanent.
- Session decompiles preserved at **reference/dossiers/cont82/** (README indexes them + the Write_* column
  extraction pattern); the five client melee handler decompiles + dossier-ev-melee.md at cont81/.
- HANDOFF cont.83 section written (queue, remaining 6/33/6 lists, methods, task list).

### The live-playtest loop (cont.82 continued; user driving; commits 3c4c848..e8592ad)
User feedback answered with binary RE, applied same-session:
- **U3+F4 (b4f464c)** SrvSett + weaponrestriction · **U4b (a49bc21)** TSFade (slow-stretched, engine-exact
  client parse) · **U5+F2b (f9667b7)** CustomWP pipeline + iPrice column (disasm-corrected: M60 8000,
  skorpion 1100) + live buy prices + loadweapons/saveweapons · **Wires+DecideGamePlay (a0781dd)** —
  the MODE BYTE decoded: rules+0 = DecideGamePlay 0/1, InitObjectives promotes team maps 2/3
  (ts_objective_manager presence); Wires gates on 3; the dead "lms" cvar reads fixed to g_lastManStanding.
- **F5 singles + powerup fixes (3c4c848)**: GetRandomPosition/PlayerIsCheating/TSCountPlayers/
  GetBodyByItems(+5 body columns extracted, wired into Deploy); POWERUP: EF_DIMLIGHT was invented (orig
  ORs EF_MUZZLEFLASH), landed bbox = (-16,-16,0)..(16,16,64) — origin AT the floor (ours floated 16u).
- **M61 grenade cluster (e8592ad)**: GrenadeFire = PIN-PULL only (no fuse!); GrenadeIdle = the cook
  machine (throw on release, pitch-shaped force cap 750, overhand eyes/underhand FEET 2/3 force + roll
  physics, FUSE 3.0 FROM THE THROW, holster force-throws, post-throw consume tick); TSExplosion sends
  the faithful TSCreateDebris material-1 (client owns the boom: explo/explode1-4.wav + NOSOUND fireball);
  the "sometimes slow-mo on explosion" = DoSpectacularNess roll (spectacularness cvar default 1 ≈ 2%) →
  a 1-second scale-0.25 CTSSlowMotionPoint — wired; TSPrecache @0x8f320 full map-window list (kills the
  grenbounce/explode late-precache warnings).
- **Breakable respawn (user question, ANSWERED — already reconstructed)**: break ≠ delete — hidden +
  DEAD_DEAD; an info_breakable helper (spawned when the map sets `respawntime` ≥ 0) rearms after
  respawntime (0 → DEFAULT 30 s; negative → permanent); BreakableRespawn(false) box-clear check →
  restore+re-Spawn, blocked → 5 s retry; virtuals on CBreakable + CBaseDoor + CRotDoor (angles-only) =
  breakables AND doors AND rotating doors; RestartRound force-respawns all. Parity nit: our
  CBaseDoor::RespawnThink trampoline is audit-INVENTED (doors should ride the helper) — #5 review.
Headline now: **6 missing methods · 33 invented · 6 missing free funcs** (methods left: EmptySound/
ReloadWeapon/StopReload (CTSGun) + PickUpWeapon/ShootBulletsPlayer/TSInit (CBasePlayer); free funcs left:
SetPlayerRespawnTime, TSSelectSpawnSpot, TSGetPointsForFrag, PseudoClimb, TSPlayerDisconnect,
RemoveEntityFromSlowedArray).

### freefuncs F1 + F2a + F3 applied (cont.82 continued; commits bec9d0f..189f11f)
- **F1 (bec9d0f)** the dead/trivial batch: CalcSpread/DropKickback/GetCloseCombatVectors/IsWeaponAkimbo/
  IsOnlyAkimbo (ts_gun) · GetAccelBySlots/DoSpectacularNess (TS_gamerules) · UTIL_EntInArray/
  WeaponIdFromString/TSFoundRandomEntity (**TS_util.cpp NEW**) · FixVelocity(+3 call sites)/CanJumpHigh
  (TS_pm_shared; NOT wired into PM_Jump — superjump hint refuted) · **LINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS(m61_grenade)**
  (the missing factory; the ONE intended nm delta, baseline regen). ts_shared.cpp now in the client build.
  39→26 missing free funcs.
- **F2a (d58efed)** the s_ammo_info table: full 0x38-struct + global_ammo_info[16] + compile_ammo_info
  (original write order) + get_ammo_info + **Set_ammo_count** (4 mode tables, SHARED) + compile_range_damage/
  get_range_multipler LUT, chained from compile_weapons_info. **TWO LIVE BUGS FIXED**: kAmmoMax was the +0x20
  RANGE column (9mm cap 80→real 210 — PLAYTEST-GATED buff, but it's the original); kBulletSpeedUnit was in
  compile-WRITE order (slow-mo .45 flew at .50AE speed). cal13 = 7.62x51 (M60), not .45LC. 26→21.
- **F3 ★ (189f11f)** the range-damage falloff WIRED (the gameplay headline): V1 gate resolved by a fresh
  UpdateBullet decompile — rec+0x3c = the ammo KIND (2 → form A idx=dist/30; else form B idx=dist/rangeUnit),
  damage *= clamp(1/sqrt(0.1·idx),0,1). Applied inline at BOTH damage sites (CBulletManager hit — record
  gains caliber+kind; TSFireBulletsPenetrate — per-layer re-base). + **UTIL_TraceLine_Expanded @0x5f4f4** +
  vecBoxes[33] (±32u player absbox inflate, absmax-only restore quirk) swapped into both traces.
  PLAYTEST-GATED as one "TS gunfeel" gate. 21→20.
- **U3 + F4 applied (b4f464c)**: SrvSett full (InitHUD all-four catch-up MSG_ONE; Think tail on-change
  MSG_ALL ids 0-2, id2 → Set_ammo_count BEFORE the send; caches as CTSGameRules members 0x578/0x558/0x55c) +
  the weaponrestriction system (cmd_weaponrestriction AddServerCommand + display + g_szRestrictions +
  WeaponRestrictionByID presets AND-masked by 0x586c + GetWeaponType/IsRestrictedWeapon + the BuyWeapon gate;
  default 0x1f = stock behavior). Client MsgFunc_SrvSett 4-way switch, case 2 = SHARED Set_ammo_count;
  ids 0/1/3 globals (consumers VERIFY tail). 20→17 missing free funcs.
- **REMAINING freefuncs**: F2b (iPrice extraction + CustomWP pipeline SendWeaponParams/InformClients/
  adjust/save_weapon_value + cmd_load/saveweapons + client MsgFunc_CustomWP + CTSGameRules m_bWeaponParams
  Custom/m_flHealthAbsorb — pairs with gmsg U5) · F5+ (see dossier-freefuncs §3: GetBodyByItems→Deploy,
  TSGetPointsForFrag, TSSelectSpawnSpot, SetPlayerRespawnTime→completes the TSPAward producers, DecideGamePlay,
  TSPrecache, TSPlayerDisconnect, TSCountPlayers, PlayerIsCheating, RemoveEntityFromSlowedArray→completes
  CTSKnife::Use, PseudoClimb). REMAINING gmsg: U3b Wires (decompile CheckForWires first) · U4b TSFade
  (decompile UTIL_ScreenFadeWrite @0xdcc54 first) · U5 CustomWP (with F2b).

## 2026-07-02 (cont. 81) — workflow-orchestrated RE fan-out + the file-consolidation plan applied (C1–C20)

Continued `restructure-source-parity` (NOT merged; GPG off). NEW METHOD this session (user-directed): **multi-agent
Workflows** — 4 concurrent RE workflows + 1 star-pass agent (42 subagents total, ~4.4M tokens of raw decompile kept
out of the orchestrator context), each on its own Ghidra-project lock domain (re / clientdll / none), all read-only;
every source edit applied centrally afterward. Dossiers in the session scratchpad (regenerate if gone):
`dossier-melee.md` (+`-addendum-L1-L2.md`), `dossier-gmsg.md` (+6 `star_*.md`), `dossier-freefuncs.md`
(+5 `analysis_ff_*.md`), `plan-consolidation.md` (+6 `plan_files_*.md`).

### The consolidation plan APPLIED — 20 commits (846d960..), audit FILE level now CLEAN
**22→0 FILE mismatches, 2→0 MISSING files.** Every commit build-green (`build.sh amd64`, C18 `all`) + gated on
`nm -D` T-export set EXACTLY identical to the 05be983 baseline (proven: the whole plan is text motion) + audit
monotone. C1 ts_bulletmgr→ts_bullet · C2 fog→ts_emitter · C3 knife→ts_grenades · C4 ts_gamerules→TS_gamerulesclass
· C5 GetRandomPowerup/PutPowerUp/g_iNoLowGravPowerup→ts_powerup · C6 NEW TS_gamerules.cpp (free-fn file; HaveFlag +
InitWeaponRestriction) · C7 ts_teams folded into TS_gamerulesclass · C8 CTSSuperJump→hldmcompat · C9/C10
groundweapon+groundammo→ts_worldgun · C11 →TS_objectives.cpp · C12 NINE entity files→TS_entities.cpp (binary
address order) · C13 CTSTrigger→TS_entities · C14 bomb→TS_objectives + CBasePlayer::CutWire→ts_player · C15/C16
escape+briefcase→TS_objectives · C17 audit comment-regex false-positive reword (TU-order polish deferred) · C18
pm_shared/TS_pm_shared.{h,cpp} carve-out BOTH libs (6 TS* fns de-static'd; hidden-visibility so dyn exports
unchanged) · C19 audit.py: skip `__*` RTTI junk (phantom pm_shared.c), client.dll ACCEPTED_CLIENT_FILES mapping +
report section, client.dll out of missing_files · C20 docs regen. Gotcha ×2: python "body after last include"
splits DROP defines/enums sitting between includes (SF_SLOMO_*, BOMB_*/tsbomb_wire_t) — restored by hand.
REPORT.md regen showed non-cosmetic drift → PROVED pre-existing staleness (LINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS set diffed
IDENTICAL between 05be983 and HEAD via a temp worktree), not a contract change.

### The RE dossiers (all reconcile work-lists, NOT yet applied — the next session's queue)
- **MELEE (dossier-melee.md, 9 missing methods)**: bar lives on the PLAYER (+0x774), whiff-lunge +0x79c..0x7a4,
  block windows +0x7a8/ac/b0 (value 0.5, PreThink-decayed, floor 0); UpdateMeleeBar = single drain choke-point
  (<0.01 → bar=0 + m_flNextAttack=1.5 lockout; ALWAYS sends KFuPower CHAR); twins CloseCombatAttack/ColdCockAttack
  (CheckHull trace → Victim*Hold deflect → disarm/knockback → glast_* damage); KnifeFire/KatanaFire/KatanaThrow/
  CCombatIdle on CTSGun; CTSKnife::WaitTouch replaces our invented settle/pickup set. Rename/absorb map + S0–S10
  build-green order in the dossier. **L1/L2 CLOSED STATICALLY (addendum)**: regen = PreThink
  `bar += GiveSlowMul()*frametime*15.0` (×1.5 under TS_PWUP_DBLFIRE bit 0x10 = m_iPowerups), clamp 100, init 100 in
  TSInit — our invented 25/s regen is WRONG; block windows decay by the same delta with 0-floor; bonus: GoWheel/
  CloseAttack clear the kungfu window; 4th timer +0x7b4 decays ×5. Method: objdump scan for member-offset accesses
  + nearest-nm-symbol + GOT-relative .rodata reads — no live trace needed.
- **GMSG (dossier-gmsg.md + star_*.md, 14 messages, 6 units U0–U5)**: SelAmmo(4)/ClipInfo(1) register-only;
  SetCurWeap dead (we already match); gmsgStatusText/StatusValue/Weapons/Flashlight/FlashBat = INVENTED
  registrations to DELETE (registration-set parity; gmsgWeapons removal playtest-gated vs HLU 64-bit weapon bits).

  our ts_flag.cpp registers "TSHaveFlag" → drop-in client would never get flag updates. 1-line fix queued.**
  Full 64-entry LinkUserMessages registration order recovered (star_LinkUserMessages.md).
- **FREEFUNCS (dossier-freefuncs.md, all 43 RE'd, plan F1–F10)**: s_ammo_info 16×0x38 table fully recovered
  (price/kind/maxcarry/mag/travel/falloff-range/speed/name); range-damage falloff = clamp01(1/sqrt(0.1·i)) LUT,
  two index forms (dist/30 kind==2, dist/ammoInfo[+0x20] per-caliber 800u..2000u) — our flat damage is the biggest
  gameplay gap (F3 ★). LIVE divergences found: kAmmoMax serves the FALLOFF-RANGE column as reserve cap (9mm 80 vs
  real 210, mode-scaled +0xc via missing Set_ammo_count); kBulletSpeedUnit in compile-write order not caliber
  order; cal13 = 7.62x51mm not .45LC. TS_util.cpp = CustomWP pipeline + slowed-array (+0x208[32]/+0x288 — our

### Melee dossier APPLIED through S4 (cont.81 continued; commits 4377174..40c9bb5)
S0 inert state (members+glast_*+table columns) · S1 UpdateMeleeBar + bar->player migration + RE-proven
15/s PreThink regen + VALUE window decay (m_flKungFuBlock semantics converted, all readers updated;
RegenBlockBar + 4 invented members deleted; WeaponInfo clip byte = ROUND(bar) for melee) · S2 BlockPlayer
+ PreThink root/whiff lifecycle (+ stunt reset zeroes) · S3 CheckHull + FindHullIntersectionplayer +
Victim{Katana,Knife,Kungfu}Hold (counter role-swap faithful; uncalled) · S4 the twins CloseCombatAttack/
ColdCockAttack (uncalled; DropWeapon(int,float) disarm shape added with the -2 roll VERIFY-gated INERT).
Headline now: **14 missing methods · 41 invented · 39 missing free funcs · 0 file/0 member/0 class gaps.**
S4b DropWeapon(-2) internals RE'd + implemented (decompiled @0x84900: a PRESSURE ACCUMULATOR player+0x7b4
= the 5x-decay PreThink field; thresholds katana 30 / melee cat 25 / clamp(slotCost,20,50); TSW_FLAG
undisarmable) · S5 rewired CCombatAttack + CTSStunt::CloseAttack onto CloseCombatAttack (full deflect/
counter/disarm/knockback live; miss presentation kept until S7b) + **the GoWheel dir==3 BACKKICK combo is
WIRED (UpdateMeleeBar 22.5 + backward whiff arm) — the Track-B blocker** · S9 CCombatIdle + WeaponIdle
bare-hands branch. Headline: **13 missing methods · 41 invented · 39 free funcs.**
S6 LANDED (794635e): ColdCock wrapper RE-exact (iColdCockDamage table, x2/3 stunting, 0.725 cadence,
kevlarhit confirm 60-91, twin-routed four-false) + AlternateAttack gate (active+coldcock-capable, clip
gate removed) + the DeathNotice kill-feed flavor ("Kung Fu" / "<weapon> Stock" + #TS_Coldcock broadcast).
REMAINING melee: S7a/b/c knife/katana
split (largest; MeleeAttack/ThrowKnife absorbed; knife/katana/draw.sc protocol swaps need the client side
simultaneously); S8 CTSKnife WaitTouch + settle/pickup rewire; S10 close-out. Then gmsg U0-U5 (dossier-
gmsg + star_*.md — registration parity first) and freefuncs F1-F10 (dossier-freefuncs). VERIFY tags in
code: L7 per-move whiff/rootFlag table, L10 CloseAttack drain const + top-up, backkick force base,
8-arg EMIT_SOUND_DYN, coldcock dmg bits (L5), CheckHull hull extents, whiff expiry predicate.

### ⭐ MAJOR RE CORRECTION (cont.81, user-driven): directional stunt poses — the "+0x510 never written" premise was WRONG
player+0x510 IS m_vecStuntDir: CTSStunt is EMBEDDED at CBasePlayer+0x4f0 (Jump: GoWheel((CTSStunt*)&this->
field_0x4f0)) and m_vecStuntDir = CTSStunt+0x20 → 0x510. GoRoll/GoWheel write it via the STUNT this-pointer —
invisible to every player-relative write scan (the cont.80 eedf94f "always forward" reading AND cont.81's objdump
sweep were both blind to this; the USER's original-game knowledge was right → memory
[[embedded-object-offset-blindness]]). Fixed (27fde55): Animate 0x2e/0x2f/0x30/0x31/0x32 dispatch directionally
off GetDirection(m_vecStuntDir, v_angle, 0.6, 0.3) with the ctor tables (getup dive_l/r/f/b_end · roll
roll_l/r/f/b · dive_end {roll_l, roll_r, roll_f_high, roll_b} · wheel 0/1/3/else→l/r/b/f · lowwheel 2/0/else→
f/l/r, NO lowwheel_b). GetDirection rewritten VERBATIM (@0x6b008: yaw+roll basis pitch-zeroed, right-dot ±0.6
first, fwd-dot < -0.3 = back) + ALL callers now pass NORMALIZED vectors (orig normalizes per-site; zero→(0,0,1)).
Also f85d325 (the earlier wrong always-_f fix, superseded) + backkick force = +15 doubled-KungFu (gowheel
decompile-exact, was -35 VERIFY). User-confirmed the model: lowwheel_* = double-jump moving, roll_* = double-duck,
wheel_b = standing double-jump. STILL OPEN from the playtest: wheel lands prone but "immediately gets up" (should
stay down unless moving) + prone switches too fast; the stamina-bar HUD refill (client-side KFuPower drain-only —
wire the WeaponInfo melee byte into the HUD bar + reset on respawn).

### ⭐ SECOND SYSTEMATIC CORRECTION (cont.81): entvars gravity/friction map was INVERTED (offsetof-proven)
gravity = pev+0x11c, friction = pev+0x120 (32-bit offsetof; anchors v_angle 0x74 / view_ofs 0x174 / button
0x180 / flags 0x1a4 / iuser4 0x250 all verified). The cont.80 ledger's "GoRoll gravity 0.3 (pev+0x120)" and
every derived stunt transcription had the two swapped. Swept (60086ff): GoRoll = friction 0.3 · GoWallJump =
gravity 0.75 · GoWheel = gravity 0.75 both tiers + forward-LOW friction 0.25 (the "flying" double-jump bug) ·
HandleWheel = HIGH-landing friction 0.25 + gravity-1.0 restore tail · HandleWallJump/Climb = friction 0.5 +
gravity 1.0 · HandleSlide deliberate = friction 1.0 · getup restores both. Also fixed this session: HandleWheel
is a LANDING handler (FL_ONGROUND gate, 4e4eb36 — the ungated version caused the lowwheel mid-air prone stomp)
and the directional-pose dispatch (27fde55, see the m_vecStuntDir correction above). Verify any remaining
pev-offset reading with /tmp/offcheck-style offsetof before trusting it.

### The PRONE/LYING system transcribed verbatim (cont.81 continued; user-driven playtest loop)
Model-dump ground truth (agent.mdl 171 seqs, parsed via studiohdr) + the Animate/HandleSlide decompiles settled
the whole family: settled prone = Animate case 3 = LOOPING slide_<dir>_<grip> (dir = GetDirection(m_vecStuntDir,
v_angle) with the !=2 latch; m_bDirForward==false -> forward; grip->akimbo fallback; entry guard vs last 0/8/9) ·
case 0x29 = the slide_*_end GETUP family (standups only) · 0x2a/0x2b = the LOOPING slide_f_<grip>_left/right
prone ROLLS with the m_bDirForward gate (non-forward = the original's missing slide_b_left/right quirk) ·
HandleSlide VERBATIM @0x9b9f8: FL_ONGROUND gate, slideTime<0.01 branch gates, IN_BACK friction pin, and the
strafe-roll DIRECTION RE-ANCHOR (m_vecStuntDir = aim forward, m_bDirForward=false, latch=2) — the fix for
"sideways prone can't roll"; deliberate standup arms rollTime 0.75 + player+0x78 (m_iStandUpLatch NEW member —
the cont.80 unresolved latch's WRITER found, consumer still VERIFY) · dive case 0x28 grip fallback. ALSO:
player+0x51c = m_bDirForward (CTSStunt+0x2c — second embedded-object-blindness find). HandleWheel = LANDING
handler (FL_ONGROUND; LOW->SLIDE + reversed-dir latch, HIGH->STOP+friction .25+rollTime .375; gravity restore).
USER-VALIDATED: double-jump + double-duck "absolutely nailed"; dive + landing poses per direction AND per grip
perfect. Remaining prone re-test: the strafe-roll re-anchor fix (658d211).

### ⭐ THE MOVEMENT-PHYSICS ARC (cont.81 continued): pm phase-2 recovered via user-driven probes
The roll-decel A/B ("ours slower, theirs keeps rolling") unravelled the WHOLE TS movement layer:
1. **THE ROOT CAUSE (d315000)**: the halflife-updated base DROPPED the stock `!pmove->multiplayer` gate on the
   per-move `pmove->friction = 1.0` reset → in MP pev->friction became a ONE-SHOT, silently ERASING every stunt
   friction (roll 0.3, wheel 0.25, walljump 0.5) before PM_Friction saw it (probe-proven fric=1.00 every roll
   frame; the original's SOLE reset site @0xf1229 in PM_Move is !multiplayer-gated, disasm-verified). THE THIRD
   base-SDK divergence this arc (gmsgWeapons regs, SetAnim seq-0 fallback semantics, this).
2. **PM_Friction (4511683)**: TS deltas = drop x0.75 + edgefriction only at entity friction 1.0 (control =
   max(speed, stopspeed) is STOCK — the Ghidra "control=0" was an artifact, raw-asm verified).
3. **PM_FlyMove (e4aec54)**: wall backoff = 1 + 0.01*(1-friction) (movevars->bounce coefficient replaced by
   0.01) — no stunt ricochet; surfaced as "+alt1 dive bounces off walls" once friction persisted.
4. **PM_WalkMove (50d2d3c)**: backpedal x0.8.
5. Blend snap (6fd6163): xash's CL_CompareTimestamps 1ms quantization randomly skips the sequence latch at high
   listenserver fps (GoldSrc 100fps always latches) → client re-latch shim in OUR StudioModelRenderer
   (presentation-only; SetAnim @0x5d7e4 decompile-diffed byte-equivalent).
USER-VALIDATED: roll carry "PERFECT"; +alt1 dive wall-clip + slide "fantastic"; stamina HUD refills. pm phase-2 (PM_Jump/PM_Duck full diffs) still has
un-diffed remainder — the four functions above are transcribed at the divergence points found.

### SESSION CLOSE (cont.81): the RE für the whole remaining queue is DONE; application is the cont.82 work
All dossiers/plans/decompiles COMMITTED at reference/dossiers/cont81/ (README indexes applied-vs-pending).
Applied: consolidation C1-C20 · melee S0-S6+S9 · the stunt/prone/movement chapter (user-validated) · TSFlag wire
fix · stamina HUD. Pending application: melee S7abc/S8/S10 · gmsg U0-U5 · freefuncs F1-F10 · invented review +
globals tail · stunt/pm tail. Final audit: 13 missing methods · 41 invented · 39 free funcs · 17 globals ·
0 file/0 member/0 class. HANDOFF cont.82 section written (methods, queue, task list, gotchas).

### STILL OPEN (cont.81 → next)
- **Apply the dossiers**: melee S0–S10 (UpdateMeleeBar unblocks the GoWheel backkick = stunt tail), gmsg U0–U5
  (TSFlag 1-liner first), freefuncs F1–F10 (F3 falloff playtest-gated). All work-lists are commit-ordered.
- Track B stunt tail unchanged (cont.80 STILL-OPEN list) + task #8 invented-method review (CTSGameRules 11,
  CBasePlayer TS* 8) + TU-order polish (C17 deferral) + runtime smoke points from the plan (tm_avana, ts_wyndham,
  ctb map, stunt prediction) — ALL of C1–C20 is nm-gated but UNPLAYTESTED.

## 2026-07-01 (cont. 80) — CTSAnimation Region B + fire/grenade faithful; live-trace proved m_fSequenceFinished works

Continued `restructure-source-parity` (NOT merged; GPG off). Focus: the CTSAnimation 3rd-person tail (task #3),
driven by a LIVE gdb trace of OUR OWN build. Commits: `fea34f9` (Region B), `cdc6cc9` (tooling), `b4d6be4`
(fire/grenade), `eedf94f` (prone/getup/roll dir source). All build `scripts/build.sh amd64 all` clean.

### cont.80 continued (2026-07-01/02) — the WHOLE CTSStunt acrobatics system, playtest+RE driven (10 commits)
After the CTSAnimation tail, the user set a `/goal` (Stop hook) to fix the 3rd-person stunt behaviours and drove
an iterative playtest loop. Every "does X do Y?" was settled by RE (decompile the original CTSStunt fn) + a live
playtest, NOT by guessing. Commits `fea34f9..07494ea`. The full input→move map (RE-confirmed, user-validated):
- **Double-tap DUCK (running ≥80) → dive-ROLL** = `CTSStunt::GoRoll` (roll_f). Original caller = `CBasePlayer::Duck`
  on the IN_DUCK edge (only caller — RE'd via re.sh refs + the cached Duck decompile). `a245229` wired it (GoRoll
  had ZERO callers = dead), `8a82ee9` fixed GoRoll's gate: it's a DOUBLE-TAP via `m_flRollNextTime` (ABSOLUTE
  re-arm timestamp, time+0.3 on fail, 0 on success; airborne needs it armed, ground 1st-tap arms/2nd-tap rolls).
  Our old GoRoll compared the roll DURATION `m_flRollTime` against absolute `gpGlobals->time` (always true → roll
  ALWAYS failed) AND the fail-path set `m_flRollTime = time+0.3` (absolute), CORRUPTING the duration so the getup
  timer never fired AND HandleStunt's `m_flRollTime>0.001` guard tripped forever → that ONE bug was blocking the
  dive, the walljump, AND causing "press duck → stuck ducked". GoRoll sets gravity=0.3 (pev+0x120), not friction.
- **Double-tap JUMP → wheel/cartwheel FLIP** = `CTSStunt::GoWheel` (front/side/back flip landing prone; backward =
  feet). Original caller = `CBasePlayer::Jump` on the IN_JUMP edge (before the normal jump) — RE'd via the Jump
  decompile. `20aa568` wired it (Jump never called GoWheel) + fixed GoWheel's double-tap gate (`time <=
  m_flWheelNextTime` + on-ground/within-0.7s-of-ground via m_flLastStunt). `07494ea` fixed the tiers: aim-up
  (v_angle.x<-10)/backward = HIGH wheel `iuser4 PRONE|WHEEL_HI|DIVE_MED` + friction 0.75; level/forward = LOW wheel
  `PRONE|WHEEL_LO|DIVE_LOW` + friction 0.75, forward(dir==2) gravity 0.25. Ours had STOP/DIVE_LOW + gravity↔friction
  swapped → "behaved like a roll" at 30° up instead of the dive-to-feet. (User found the 30°-up nuance.)
- **+alt1 at a wall (facing+close, jump NOT held) → BACKFLIP** = HandleStunt `!(button&IN_JUMP) && (m_afButtonPressed
  &IN_ALT1) → CheckForWallJump → GoWallJump` (RE-confirmed at CTSStunt_all.txt HandleStunt call-site; also a mid-
  climb path in HandleWallClimb). `90e73f6` fixed GoWallJump gravity→friction; pm_shared TSWallJump `-forward*210`,
  `z=√56000≈236.6` (was a tuned 270). The backflip was ALSO blocked by the GoRoll m_flRollTime corruption (guard);
  fixing GoRoll unblocked it. USER-VALIDATED both work.
- **GETUP** (`fea34f9`+`90e73f6`+`4204c4b`): Region B hold-guards transcribed 1:1 from Animate@0x5b470 (the
  swallow/freeze fix); the Play getup is ONE state-cleanup block (NO Animate — the getup ANIM is only in Landing's
  roll branch); HandleSlide's deliberate-prone branch arms m_flRollTime=0.75. Prone pose = slide_<dir>_<grip> (the
  ctor pose table `this+0xdc`=slide_*_end are the RECOVERY/getup anims, NOT the settled prone — using them + our
  every-frame FORCE re-dispatch made "constantly getting up"; `4204c4b` reverted to the lying pose). Pose tables
  recovered from the CTSAnimation ctor@0x5b0c8: prone this+0xdc={slide_l/r/f/b_end}, getup this+0x11c={dive_*_end}
  →dive_f_end, roll this+0x15c={roll_l/r/f/b}→roll_f, dive_end this+0x19c→roll_f_high (getup/roll/dive_end always
  FORWARD because player+0x510, their dir source, is NEVER written in the binary → GetDirection returns forward).
- **superjump-land sound on a normal jump** (`a245229`): player.cpp low-grav block set m_bSuperJumpAir on ANY
  airborne frame; removed the `else if(!onGround)` so only a real duck+jump lift arms the land thud.
- **prone roll L/R** (`a245229`): HandleSlide auto-slide maps IN_MOVELEFT→Animate(0x2a), IN_MOVERIGHT→0x2b (both
  no-FORCE, no loop), else 0x29 (RE says no-strafe = Animate(3); kept 0x29 = the validated static prone).

**LIVE-TRACE TOOLING built (reuse it):** `BUILDTYPE=RelWithDebInfo scripts/build.sh` (build.sh honors $BUILDTYPE;
Release has no DWARF so gdb can't read members). `test.sh GDB=<script.gdb>` launches xash UNDER gdb batch (gdb=
parent satisfies ptrace_scope=1, NO sudo). Probe = a python `gdb.Breakpoint` on the fn, `stop()` returns False
(logs, never halts), reads args from ENTRY registers ($rsi/$edx — params optimized out of scope at -O2), casts via
`gdb.parse_and_eval` in the SELECTED frame (`gdb.newest_frame().select()`; global lookup_type fails). Scripts in
scratchpad/anim_log.gdb. **⭐ decisive win:** the trace PROVED m_fSequenceFinished DOES advance server-side (hits 1
at pev->frame 255 via PostThink StudioFrameAdvance) — the prior "it doesn't" premise (and the timer substitution +
the reverted 4-region rewrite) was WRONG; the reverted rewrite froze because its hold cases fell through (no break).

### STILL OPEN (cont.80 → next; behaviour-verified where noted, else playtest-gated / RE-flagged)
- **GoWheel pitch tiers** (`07494ea`) — awaiting the user's re-test (aim-up dive-to-feet vs level roll).
- **Backward double-jump BACKKICK combo** (GoWheel dir==3): needs `CBasePlayer::UpdateMeleeBar` (one of the 19
  missing methods) + the whiff-lunge params player+0x79c..0x7a8. Flagged in 07494ea.
- **Roll DIRECTIONAL variants** (roll_l/r/b): the roll always plays roll_f because Animate case 0x2f (ROLL) reads
  the dir from player+0x510 (never written→forward). The user wants roll_l/r/b. RE how the original gets a
  directional roll (does GoRoll write player+0x510? or is m_iDirection the source? — recheck; player+0x510
  "never written" was from a grep, re-verify against GoRoll/GoWheel writes).
- **GETUP ANIMATION on the deliberate prone-standup**: the original plays NO anim there (only the roll-landing
  animates); the user WANTS an anim. Region B case 0x29 swallows a 0x2e dispatch while PRONE set → to animate the
  deliberate standup you'd need to clear PRONE first or use a non-swallowed path = an intentional divergence; ask.
- **HandleSlide full auto-slide** (RE = Animate(3) no-strafe / 0x2a / 0x2b): we kept 0x29 for no-strafe to preserve
  the validated pose. The stand-up latch player+0x78 is unresolved (timer-only getup) — live-trace its clear.
- **Superjump ANIMATION** (ducking in mid-air): the m_bLowGravity superjump is a rough "per playtest" reconstruction,
  not the faithful CTSStunt superjump/morfy — RE the real one (Animate 0x39 morfy).
- **Directional DEATH** (Animate case 7): needs player field_0x10c semantics + the die_spinback RANDOM_LONG range.
- **CTSAnimation exact pose tables** are now recovered (ctor@0x5b0c8) — prone/getup/roll/dive_end names are RE-exact.

### ⭐ THE DECISIVE FINDING (kills the prior premise): m_fSequenceFinished DOES advance server-side
The cont.78/79 revert (6a8ca20) of the 4-region Animate rewrite was justified as "m_fSequenceFinished isn't
advanced for the server-side player." **That was WRONG.** Live-traced our own hl.so (built RelWithDebInfo so gdb
can read members — see tooling below): a register-read probe on CTSAnimation::Animate logged
pPlayer->m_fSequenceFinished every call. It reaches 1 exactly at pev->frame==255 for non-looping seqs (seq 64,
seq 61 observed). PostThink's StudioFrameAdvance (player.cpp:2925) advances it. So the timer substitution was
unnecessary; the reverted rewrite actually froze because its Region-B hold cases FELL THROUGH (no `break`) into
`case TSA_DIE: return` (unconditional hold). The original has an explicit break per case.

### Live-trace tooling (reusable — `[[live-original-ts-debuggable]]` but for OUR build)
- `BUILDTYPE=RelWithDebInfo scripts/build.sh` (build.sh now honors $BUILDTYPE; default Release has NO DWARF, so
  gdb resolves function symbols but not types/members — blocks member reads). `test.sh GDB=<script.gdb>` launches
  xash UNDER gdb batch (gdb=parent satisfies ptrace_scope=1, no sudo). Probe: a python gdb.Breakpoint on
  CTSAnimation::Animate, stop() returns False (logs, never halts), reads pPlayer from $rsi (params are optimized
  out of scope at -O2; the entry regs this=rdi/pPlayer=rsi/activity=edx are intact at the first-line bp), casts
  via gdb.parse_and_eval in the selected frame (lookup_type fails globally). Scripts in scratchpad/anim_log.gdb.

### Fixed + USER-VERIFIED
- **Region B hold-guards** (`fea34f9`): transcribed Animate@0x5b470 switch(m_iLastActivity) 1:1 (all stunt/jump/
  slide/die cases, break per case, iuser4 & TSSTUNT_PRONE(0x4) gates, a1 exclusions, IsAlive/IsOnLadder). Fixes
  dive/prone-as-crouch: without it the per-frame PostThink Animate(1/6) + a competing fire re-forced the pose
  every frame (seq flip-flopped, frame reset -> crouch). Trace after fix: seq holds, frame 0->32 smooth. ✅
- **Fire/grenade** (`b4d6be4`): fire case 0/8/9 — airborne early-return; sliding (iuser4&0x20) plays
  slide_f_<grip>_shoot (player+0x51c stored-dir path is DEAD CODE, 0x51c never written); the "2" alt-stance
  variant; FIRE_SLIDEL/R append _left/_right; removed invented shoot_akimbo_left. Grenade adds iuser4&0x30 guard.
- **prone/getup/roll/dive_end direction source** (`eedf94f`): getup/roll/dive_end take dir from player+0x510 (the
  stored dive vector) which is NEVER written -> always (0,0,0) -> GetDirection=forward, so they DON'T re-orient;
  prone uses FROZEN m_iDirection not a fresh GetDirection. Our old fresh-GetDirection churned the seq on strafe
  (re-orient + the blink). USER-VERIFIED: blink GONE, prone pose FIXED (not re-orienting). ✅

### OPEN (goal active — RE-verify, in progress via a CTSStunt dossier subagent)
- **getup/roll never plays** — stays prone. ROOT CAUSE identified: our getup gate (ts_stunt.cpp:158) dispatches
  Animate(0x2e) but does NOT clear TSSTUNT_PRONE, so my new Region B (case 0x29 holds on iuser4&PRONE) swallows
  the getup dispatch (last=PRONE still). Need the original's standup path: does it clear PRONE / is prone seq
  looping. (Subagent REing Play@0x8a014.)

  needs field_0x10c semantics + the die_spinback RANDOM_LONG range (deferred, not a user complaint).

## 2026-06-29 (cont. 77) — audit trustworthiness push: member/global/invented levels made honest

Continued the source-parity restructure on `restructure-source-parity` (NOT merged; GPG off). Baseline green
(`build.sh amd64 all`, glibc 2.14). The user opted to "keep grinding safe parity work" while the PLAYTEST
gate (#2) waits on them; held the playtest-gated melee/CTSGun reshapes. Drove the audit's false-positive
noise out so the work-list is real. **Headline: missing methods 20→19, invented methods 104→42, missing
members 19→0, invented globals 8→6, missing globals 19→17** (+46 client + 15 stock now bucketed transparently).

### Source parity (behavior-preserving)
- **gmsg server-var renames** (`3649f43`): `gmsgActItems`→`gmsgTSActiveItems`, `gmsgWStatus`→`gmsgTSWeaponStatus`
  (the original's names per inventory). Wire strings ("ActItems"/"WStatus") untouched → drop-in-safe. The vars
  compile into BOTH hl.so + client.so (CTSGun is client-predicted) — rebuild `all` or the audit sees stale syms.
  The OTHER ~14 missing gmsg globals map to the MISSING user-message list (server-send + client-hook
  unimplemented) = genuine protocol RE, overlaps client-parity #7, NOT renames.
- **CTSGun::GrenadeThrow → GrenadeFire** (`71312c5`): our own comment already said `@GrenadeFire__6CTSGun`;
  `GrenadeFire` was simultaneously in CTSGun's MISSING list → pure rename resolved BOTH sides (double win).

### Audit trustworthiness (the cont.76 theme, continued)
- **srcparse pointer-to-member detection + array-index collapse** (`5f36164`): `void (CBaseEntity::*m_pfnThink)();`
  has the name buried in parens so DECLRE/INLINE_METHODRE both missed it (added PMEMBERRE → CBaseEntity 4
  false-missing gone). And the original's DEFINE_ARRAY save fields expand to indexed names (`targets[0..7]`),
  never matching our single array member → collapse `name[i]`→`name` in the diff (CTSObjectiveManager 12 gone).
- **CTSPhysicObject curator mis-hoist fixed** (`3d8a670`): `m_flExpire`@0x88/`m_pOwner`@0x8c/`m_iType`@0xa0 were
  `curated` rows sitting PAST the class's binary footprint (auto fields stop at 0x84) — CTSFlag/CTSWorldGun-shaped
  fields an old curate run hoisted onto the slow-mo base, persisted via `keep`. Removed the 3 rows from
  `members_re.tsv`; `export.py` regen of ts_inventory.json removes EXACTLY those 3 (semantic diff verified — no
  other method/global/member changed). **Missing members → 0** (member level fully clean).
- **CLIENT-NOSYM bucket** (`95c75d4`): CHudTSBuyMenu/CHudTSWeaponBar fold in with an EMPTY original method set
  (client.dll has no symbols) → the audit was flagging all 46 of our methods as "invented." Moved them to a
  transparent UNVERIFIABLE bucket (surfaced, not counted). Invented 103→57.
- **STOCK-SDK whitelist** (`4aab765`): new `scripts/coverage/stock_methods.py` caches exact `(class,method)`
  DEFINED in `upstream/64bit-demo` → `stock_methods.tsv`; audit splits invented methods that are exact-match
  stock-inherited (EquipWeapon/InitStatusBar/DoRetireWeapon/FAllowFlashlight/… 15) into a STOCK-SDK bucket.
  **Exact-match ONLY** — a bare-name match would wrongly whitelist TS virtual overrides (PlayerKilled/IsTeamplay/
  Classify) whose names also live on other stock classes; those stay VISIBLE for review. Wired into run.py.
  Invented 57→42.

### Invented-method REVIEW complete (task #5, via dossier subagent → `scratchpad/dossier-invented-methods.md`)
All 104 classified: **46 CLIENT-NOSYM** (whitelisted) · **27 STOCK-SDK** (15 exact-whitelisted, ~12 are
TS virtual overrides that stay visible) · **22 LEGIT-HELPER** (original inlined them; keepable split-outs) ·
**1 NAME-MISMATCH** (GrenadeFire — done) · **2 UNSURE** (CTSGun::MeleeAttack≈KnifeFire+KatanaFire merge;
ThrowKnife≈KnifeFire throw-branch — confirm via RE, playtest-gated) · **6 DRIFT to reconsider (deferred,
playtest-gated):** `CTSGun::SwitchBarrel` (invented akimbo barrel-cycle replacing the orig SecondaryAttack
@0x817a8 fire-the-other-hand); `CTSKnife::{BecomePickup,PickupTouch,StickAt}` (net-new "every drop is
pickable"); `CTSKnife::{StartSettle,SettleThink}` (think-based settle vs the orig touch-based WaitTouch/
WaitThink @0x6dce8). These touch combat/throw mechanisms → reconcile ON a green playtest.

### Free-function level made honest + 2 latent-bug fixes + the Sparta extraction (the rest of cont.77)
Categorized all 94 missing free funcs (dossier subagent → `scratchpad/dossier-freefuncs.md`): 38 Write_<weapon>
consolidation · 19 already-exists · 5 playtest-gated-melee · 13 unsure (need Ghidra) · 19 genuine-RE.
- **srcparse credits SOURCE-level free funcs** (`f6bbba8`): the free-func audit was nm-only, so static
  single-caller fns the compiler inlines away (TSDive/CheckPowerups/CalcMiniminVotants/compile_weapons_info)
  read as MISSING though present + faithful in source. Fixed like the member level (scan source): added
  `pm_shared/` to srcparse SRC_DIRS + Allman-brace (sig line, `{` next line) and K&R split-form (type on one
  line, NAME(params) next) detection via next-line-`{` lookahead. Resolved 8 genuinely-present functions (94→86).
- **Entity-classname bug fixes** (`acf5ed3`): the "missing free funcs" deadcorpse/knife/shrapnel were the
  original's LINK factory names; we'd used ts_-prefixed names — and the mismatch had bitten TWICE (the
  "missing symbol = logic-mismatch signal" the user wants): (1) `weapons.cpp` precached "deadcorpse" but the
  entity linked as ts_corpse → the corpse's models NEVER precached; (2) `ts_worldgun.cpp` already checks
  `FClassnameIs(...,"knife")` but our knife linked ts_knife → that touch-ignore never matched. Renamed LINK +
  Create/classname/self-check to the original names. Classnames are server-internal (not the wire contract), so
  drop-in is unaffected; the corpse/knife fixes ARE behaviour-affecting (playtest will confirm). **m61_grenade
  DEFERRED** — CreateGrenade sets classname "grenade" not "m61_grenade"; needs RE to settle (don't guess).
- **Sparta()/SetSpartaWeapon parity** (`3d46f67`): renamed our setter SetSparta→SetSpartaWeapon and extracted
  the 32-call combat-param-override block out of compile_weapons_info into a `static Sparta()` invoked at the
  same site (verbatim 32 calls, behaviour-preserving — these set the combat stats the game actually uses).
- **CONSOLIDATED bucket** (`03191a0`): the 38 Write_<weapon> data-init the original splits one-per-file are our
  g_weaponInfo table + Sparta() (deliberate consolidation, NOT gaps) — split into a transparent labeled bucket.
  **Missing free funcs now 43 REAL gaps** + 38 consolidated.

### Audit headline at session end (honest at EVERY level)
`0 missing/invented classes · 19 missing methods · 42 invented methods (+46 client-unverifiable +15 stock-SDK) ·
0 missing members · 43 missing free funcs (+38 Write_ consolidated) · 22 file mismatches · 17 missing globals ·
6 invented globals`. The 43 real free-func gaps: the weapon-param tuning subsystem (TS_util.cpp:
AdjustSpecificWeapon/adjust+save_weapon_value/SendWeaponParams/InformClientsOnWeaponsParams + gmsgTSCustomWeaponParams),
the range-damage falloff (TS_gun.cpp compile_range_damage/get_range_multipler/Set_ammo_count — bulletmgr uses
RAW damage = a real gameplay gap), gamerules pieces (DecideGamePlay/TSSelectSpawnSpot/GetAccelBySlots), pm_shared
helpers (CanJumpHigh/FixVelocity/PseudoClimb — adjacent addrs, need Ghidra), melee Victim*Hold + FindHullIntersectionplayer
(playtest-gated). UNSURE to settle via Ghidra: CalcSpread vs our ScaleSpread; DropKickback vs our VKickback.

### ⭐ FIRST PLAYTEST of cont.74–77 (user-driven, graphical xash) — VALIDATED + bug list
**VALIDATED (working):** breakables shatter ✓; weapon throw arc/spin/drop-sound ✓ (the cont.76 ThrowWeapon
velocity formula is CONFIRMED); slow-motion ✓; no unknown-command spam ✓; dive FIRST-person ✓.
**BUGS found (root causes diagnosed, fixes NOT yet made — need RE/live-trace, don't guess):**
1. ✅ **FIXED (`f721c00`, needs re-test on tm_avana): Round clock never showed** — gmsgTSRoundTime is
   registered ONLY in StartRoundTimer, but RestartRound armed m_flRoundEnd inline first → Think's
   `if(m_flRoundEnd==0) StartRoundTimer()` never fired → message unregistered → clock-send skipped. Fixed by
   routing RestartRound's timer-arm through StartRoundTimer. [original diag below]
   **m_flRoundEnd** (the round timer) is armed ONLY for team/lms modes
   (`ts_gamerules.cpp:384` DecideGamePlay `if (IsTeamMode() || lms)`, and `:731` StartRoundTimer gated
   `IsTeamMode()`). User's current mode arms neither → no RoundTime msg → no clock. RoundTime is registered +
   client-hooked fine (cl_dll/roundtime.cpp). User sees round SUMMARIES (CheckDeads resolves rounds w/o a
   timer). ACTION: determine which TS mode the test is in + RE whether the original arms the round timer there
   (theOne/DM round modes) — likely the cont.76 IsTeamMode gating is too narrow.
2. ✅ **PARTIAL FIX (`1fcd627`, re-test): thrown weapon despawn** — registered the original's `weaponstay`
   cvar (default 15, recovered from .so cvar_t @0x108f4c; distinct from stock mp_weaponstay=0). Dropped guns
   now persist 15s not the 5s floor. The infinite-SLIDE is SEPARATE and our code is FAITHFUL — verified the
   original CTSWorldGun::Spawn@0x90954 uses a ZERO-size bbox and Fall@0x90d84 settles on
   `(FL_ONGROUND && vel<3)->OnGround`, IDENTICAL to ours. The xash test engine likely doesn't set FL_ONGROUND
   on a zero-size MOVETYPE_BOUNCE (no friction → slides); GoldSrc/ReHLDS (deploy target) settles. Decide: leave
   faithful, or add an xash-compat tiny bbox. [orig diag:]
   **Thrown weapon never settled + despawned ~2s** — `CTSWorldGun::Spawn` uses a ZERO-size bbox
   (`UTIL_SetSize g_vecZero`) so the engine never sets FL_ONGROUND → `Fall()`'s settle gate
   (`FL_ONGROUND && vel<3`) never fires → slides until `m_flExpire` removes it. AND the lifetime reads
   `CVAR_GET_FLOAT("weaponstay")` but we only register `mp_weaponstay` (stock name) → returns 0 → clamped 5s.
   The original registers `weaponstay` (it's in coverage's MISSING server cvars). ACTION: RE the original
   worldgun bbox + settle + lifetime (dc.sh server 0xa0954 Spawn / 0xa0d84 Fall — first cut captured but messy).
3. ✅ **FIXED + playtest-validated (`dff06ec`): ~5s teleport in plain DM** was the ROUND RESTART (not auto-spawn).
   (user clarified). ROOT CAUSE: `CTSGameRules::Init()` (in the ctor) arms `m_flRoundRestart = time + 5.0f`
   UNCONDITIONALLY (`ts_gamerules.cpp:355`); Think (`:724`) then fires `RestartRound()` 5s into EVERY map, and
   RestartRound `respawn()`s ALL players (`:433`) → teleport-to-spawn + redeploy. On non-team ts_kissmeyerbasic
   `IsTeamMode()` is false (keys off a `ts_objective_manager` entity) so it's a ONE-TIME +5s event, not a cycle;
   in team mode it recurs. The whole round-restart subsystem landed THIS restructure (commit `0a7832c`) = a
   cont.74-77 regression. The +5s Init restart's PURPOSE is deferred InitObjectives/SetObjective (map entities
   exist by then) — but it shouldn't force-respawn players in plain DM (no rounds). FIX (needs RE of the
   original Init@0x67d6c / RestartRound@0x67920): gate the first-restart player-respawn to round-based modes,
   OR run the deferred objective-init without the all-player respawn in DM. Tightly coupled to bug #1 (the round
   clock): on tm_avana RestartRound DOES send gmsgTSRoundTime (`:411`) yet no clock shows — same subsystem.
4. ✅ **FIXED (`b543be6`, re-test): Stock bottom HUD** — CHudBattery was already suppressed; CHudHealth/
   CHudAmmo/CHudAmmoSecondary still drew (duplicating TSStatus/TSAmmo/TSWeaponBar). Early-returned those Draws.
   SAFE because weapon-SELECT logic is in CHudAmmo::Think / m_TSWeaponBar.SelectColumn (slot keys route there),
   NOT in Draw — verified. Render-only suppression.
5. **Loadout intermittent at first-join** (works most times) — buy-menu/loadout send race (the TSSendBuyMenu
   re-send-each-tick code already hints at known timing fragility).
7. ✅ **FIXED (`3b3708c`, re-test): brass casings stopped on fire** — cl_dll/ev_ts.cpp EV_TSFire ejects via
   EV_FindModelIndex("models/shell.mdl"), but TS never precached it (only stock weapons did; TS uses
   weapon_tsgun) → model index 0 → no casing. Added PRECACHE_MODEL(shell.mdl + shotgunshell.mdl) to
   PrecacheAllTSWeapons.
8. ✅ **FIXED (`7999cc8`, re-test): Akimbo/gold silent (no fire sound+casing) until reload** — MECHANISM:
   CTSGun::Fire() (ts_gun.cpp:651) gates `if (m_iClip <= 0) { PlayEmptySound(); return; }` BEFORE dispatching
   to AkimboFire/StandardFire — so a weapon that deploys with m_iClip==0 yields empty clicks (no EV_TSFire =
   no predicted fire sound AND no brass casing, both come from that event); a reload refills the clip and it
   works. TRIGGER (why akimbo/gold deploy at clip 0 SOMETIMES) is NOT visible statically: TakeWeapon sets the
   akimbo/gold clip correctly (ts_gun.cpp:344/352) and SelectWeapon->LoadActiveFromItem loads it on deploy, and
   the loadout path goes through GiveTSWeapon->TakeWeapon too. So it's an intermittent client/server m_iClip
   sync/race on deploy of a morphed akimbo type (the fire event is FEV_NOTHOST → the local player relies on the
   PREDICTED Fire(), so a client m_iClip that's 0 for the deploy window = silent fire). NEXT: LIVE TRACE
   (scripts/live.py) — break on the deploy + first Fire() of a gold/akimbo and read m_iClip server vs predicted.
   FIX: AkimboFire gates on m_items[].leftClip+rightClip (server-only, NOT in prediction data) → client saw
   0+0, EMPTY-returned, never played the FEV_NOTHOST fire event; a client reload repopulated the barrels (the
   'after reload' tell). Reconstruct leftClip/rightClip on the client in SetWeaponData from the synced combined
   m_iClip (server keeps m_iClip=left+right). [[predicted-weapon-gotchas]]
6. ✅ **REWRITTEN (`482a099`, NEEDS PLAYTEST): dive 3rd-person looked like crouch** — CTSAnimation::Animate
   was a simplified A/C-only shape; RE'd the full original 4-region function (dossier
   `scratchpad/dossier-ctsanimation.md`). Two faults: Region-C cases RETURNED instead of breaking into the
   Region-D LEG-gait tail (pev->gaitsequence stayed 0 = crouch pose under the dive body), and Region B (the
   per-m_iLastActivity HOLD guards) was absent so the per-frame PostThink Animate(1/6) stomped every stunt one
   frame in. Rewrote to faithful A/B/C/D + P2 name fixes (PRONE->slide_<dir>_end, ROLL->roll_<dir>,
   DIVE_END->roll_l/r/f_high/b, lowwheel no _b). PLAYTEST: dive + all stunts + normal walk/run/crouch/fire gait
   (a core-dispatcher rewrite — watch for any animation regression). P3 deferred: player+0x478 second
   anim-string (HandleCloseCombat block pick + standing-gait), slide_bl/br dot test, BulletDance inverted gate,
   signed leg-timer, the shoot_*2 slide-fire variant. CTSAnimation members/SetAnim flags confirmed 1:1.
6b. **(old) Dive 3rd-person looks like crouch** (1st-person spot-on) — `CTSAnimation::Animate` (gait/anim) NOT ported
   (known, VERIFICATION.md). Cosmetic.

### NEXT (the audit is now an honest driver — remaining work is genuine-RE or playtest-gated)
The 42 invented are mostly keepable helpers + visible virtual overrides; only the 6 drift are actionable and
playtest-gated. The 43 real free funcs are genuine RE (range-damage falloff is the notable gameplay gap) +
melee-gated. 22 file mismatches + 2 missing files are structural (entity-file consolidation + client.dll HUD
track) — high-churn, hold until playtest. **PLAYTEST (#2) remains the GATE before merge** — the corpse/knife
classname fixes this session are behaviour-affecting and want confirmation.



After closing the stock-class gaps, the user pushed for an EXHAUSTIVE, trustworthy 1:1 check at every
level (file→class→method→variable→global→free function), where any discrepancy = a logic-mismatch
signal to re-RE. Two phases:

### Phase 1 — made `audit.py` trustworthy (the foundational win), commit `a77ff52`
The old audit had blind spots that polluted MISSING/INVENTED. Built **`scripts/coverage/srcparse.py`** —
a single-pass tokenizer (handles line/block comments + string/char literals so braces never desync) that
brace-scans BOTH .cpp and .h, yielding per-class members, the class→base hierarchy, in-body (inline)
methods, and file-scope free functions. (A naive regex was leaking quotes from `//` comments across
newlines and SILENTLY DROPPING whole classes, e.g. CMultiManager — class discovery 240→505.) Wired into
audit.py: members now from .cpp too; methods resolve through inheritance + inline; a NEW **free-function
level** diffs each TS_*.cpp's free/static funcs vs our build symbols. Fixed a c++filt-spacing bug that
made every arg-taking free function read as missing. **Result (now ACCURATE, not blind-spot noise):**
0 missing/0 invented classes, 33→29 missing methods, 105 invented methods, **19** missing members (was
54 false), **~94 missing free functions (a whole level that never existed)**. KEY LESSON (user's): the
logic is OFTEN already implemented — just `static`/inlined/renamed/as-a-method — so a "missing" symbol
usually means MOVE it to the faithful shape, not rewrite.

### Phase 2 — closing gaps by MOVING existing logic (commits `70172f1`,`b79559e`,`0c89442`,`03adb27`)
- **TS_shared.cpp slow-motion math** (`70172f1`): FixedSlowAmt/FixedSlowMul/InterpolateSlowMotion/
  GetBulletVelocityMult — all already present but SCATTERED (static in ts_bulletmgr, inlined in
  PreThink's fuser1 ramp, inlined in GiveSlowMul). Consolidated into ts_shared.cpp/.h as the original's
  free functions; call sites route through them. Verified each vs @0x890bc/0x890e4/0x8910c/0x89160.
  Zero behaviour change.
- **GetSpeedBySlots** (`b79559e`): our `TSSlotBaseSpeed` WAS this (@0x66bd4) — renamed. **InitWeaponRestriction**:
  extracted from the inlined bare `0x1f` in get_weapon_restriction.
- **CBasePlayer DropWeapon + CutWire** (`0c89442`): free functions TSDropWeapon/TSCutWire → methods
  (the original's shape; body unchanged via a `pPlayer = this` alias; callers + dead decl updated).
- **CBasePlayer SetPlayerSpeed + SetPlayerGravity** (`03adb27`): RE'd @0x83068/@0x85b70 (clamp [0,330] +
  pfnSetClientMaxspeed; conditional gravity set). Wired the One's full-speed site.
- **CBasePlayer method grind cont.** (`44fc97e`,`5236d40`,`945a343`,`0832bda`): more RE'd from TS_player.cpp/
  TS_spectator.cpp — PunchScreen (@0x85f70, empty in shipped game), GetMeleeMultiplier (@0x865d0,
  (max(blockbar,0)*0.5+50)*0.01), DropArmor (@0x83a3c) + DropAmmo (@0x846f0) (drop armor/ammo-reserve as a
  CTSAmmoPack, reuse CreateAmmoPack), UpdatePlayerState (@0x82a08, pose state; CAUGHT a bug: orig's 0x4000 is
  FL_DUCKING not FL_FROZEN — wired into PreThink), Observer_Idle (@0x89ca4, spectator auto-advance, maps to
  our Observer_FindNextPlayer/m_hObserverTarget). **CBasePlayer 33 -> 23 missing methods** over the grind.

### Where it stands (honest) — NOT complete; the audit is now a trustworthy work-list
Remaining genuine gaps (false positives now filtered out): **29 missing methods** (CBasePlayer is ~18 —
ShootBulletsPlayer/UpdateMeleeBar/BlockPlayer inlined in the PLAYTESTED melee/bullet path = extract
carefully; PickUpWeapon = TSPickUpWeapon but signature differs from the orig's status-based one; genuinely
missing DropAmmo/DropArmor/ThrowWeapon/PunchScreen/TSInit/TSUse/UpdatePlayerState/Observer_Idle/StopObserver/
GetMeleeMultiplier/CheckHull/CheckForWires). **~94 missing free funcs** (~38 = the deliberate Write_<weapon>
data-table consolidation, NOT gaps; the rest = move-existing or genuine: TS_gun.cpp Sparta/compile_*/
CalcSpread, TS_pm_shared.c movement/stunt, TS_util.cpp helpers, Victim{Kungfu,Knife,Katana}Hold inlined in
melee). **19 missing members** (mostly the CTSObjectiveManager messages[]/targets[] DEFINE_ARRAY artifact +
CTSPhysicObject curator mis-hoist = known-false, each needs a 1-line confirm). **22 file mismatches, 2 missing
files** (CBulletManager/the HUD client.dll classes). **The drop-in METHOD: audit.py <Class> is now reliable;
"missing" = MOVE existing logic or RE.** ~9 commits this sub-session; all build amd64 server+client (glibc 2.14).
**ALL UNPLAYTESTED — flag before merge.**

### Worldgun throw/drop reconcile + the drop-in-compatibility principle (cont.76 tail), commits `cd892da`,`b34ef52`
User feedback crystallized the cardinal rule (memory `mimic-original-mechanism-for-dropin`): **mimic the original's
mechanism exactly — don't substitute our own — because drop-in client/server compatibility needs the contract to match.**
Applied to the weapon drop (dossier `scratchpad/dossier-throwchain.md`):
- Split our 4-arg `CTSWorldGun::CreateWeapon(type,status,origin,velocity)` → the original **3-arg
  `CreateWeapon(owner,type,status)`** (@0x907ec) that sets NO origin/velocity (caller's job) and RESTORED what we were
  missing: `pev->owner`, the dropped model's **skin from the dropper**, the **type-0x1d glow shell**.
- Added the real **`CBasePlayer::ThrowWeapon`** (@0x8529c) — the throw primitive (DropWeapon is its sole caller): angles
  (alive=view+offset / dead=random), CreateWeapon, origin=eye+16*fwd+lateral, **random avelocity tumble** (we weren't
  spinning the gun), then velocity. DropWeapon's branches + the death scatter route through it (TSThrowWorldGun is now a
  thin wrapper); the playtested akimbo item bookkeeping is untouched.
- **Drop sound `items/weapondrop1.wav` → `weapons/weapondrop.wav`** — a real swap-contract bug (the original asset).
- **Throw velocity** was flagged "needs a live trace," then RESOLVED by decoding the @0x85359/@0x853c1 x87 asm + reading
  the `.rodata` floats (0.9@0xf7f44, 0.33@0xf92f0, 90.0, 16.0) — ground truth, no guess:
  `velocity = 0.9*playerVelocity + S*v_forward + (0,0,0.33*S)`; alive `S=(90-pitch)*2`, dead `S=RandomLong(60,160)`.
  (.rodata-float recipe: file offset = vaddr - .rodata_vaddr + .rodata_fileoff; GOT base ebx≈0x165e10 so `-0xNNNN(%ebx)`
  = 0x165e10-0xNNNN.) CBasePlayer 100/120. ~32 commits total this session; HANDOFF cont.76 written for the next agent.

## 2026-06-29 (cont. 75) — source-parity restructure cont.: the CTF cluster, bottom-up (1:1)

Branch `restructure-source-parity` (continues cont.74; GPG signing OFF). Same loop. This session
reconstructed the **whole CTF cluster** to 1:1 parity from a dossier subagent's RE
(`scratchpad/dossier-CTF.md`). Commit `a4254ec`. Builds amd64 server+client clean (glibc 2.14).

- **Key structural finding (the carry model):** there is NO "flag follows the carrier" entity. The
  flag is a 28-byte **`s_flag_status` value struct** copied byte-for-byte at every hop (briefcase→
  flag→player→flag…); a `CTSFlag` entity exists ONLY while the flag is loose. On pickup TakeFlag
  copies the struct onto the carrier (CBasePlayer+0x7d0) and **Destroys** the flag; on drop a fresh
  loose flag is `CreateFlag`d. Our old `m_hCarrier`/`CarryThink`/`AttachTo` + the free
  `TSCreateFlag/TSDropFlag/TSPlayerHasFlag/TSReturnCarriedFlag` helpers were all INVENTED — deleted.
- **s_flag_status (player.h):** active byte / contents string_t / flagID 1..15 / team 0-based /
  lastCarrier entindex / **EHANDLE hBriefcase** (the respawn target rides INSIDE the struct).
- **CBasePlayer::TakeFlag/DropFlag + free HaveFlag** (ts_player.cpp / ts_gamerules.cpp): pickup =
  copy status + the **20 slot-weight debit** (folded into TSSlotBaseSpeed/TSPlayerFreeSlots in
  ts_gun.cpp → carrying the flag slows you, the `members-globals` rule: the "+0x548 −0x14" wasn't a
  dead member, it's the encumbrance). DropFlag(false)=spawn loose flag (toss from eye, random
  avelocity, dead→random dir 60..160), DropFlag(true)=silent capture clear. gmsgTSHaveFlag (0/1/2).
- **CTSBriefcase 6/6 0-inv** (ts_briefcase.h/.cpp): the flag REGISTRY owner — static `s_nextFlagID`
  cycling 1..15 (ctor), template status w/ EHANDLE=self (Spawn), FlagFall seeds the flag +
  gmsgTSHaveFlag type 0, **CaptureTouch** = +10 frags + gmsgScoreInfo/TeamScore/TSVoiceMessage +
  respawn the captured flag at ITS home base via the carried status' EHANDLE. `contents` is a
  **char[32]** (strncpy), not string_t. (FILE MISMATCH remains: orig groups it in TS_objectives.cpp.)
- **CTSFlag 15/15 0-inv** (ts_flag.h/.cpp) **: CTSPhysicObject** — mirrors the CTSWorldGun settle/
  bounce machine (Spawn/BounceTouch/Fall/OnGround/WaitThink/WaitTouch). CreateFlag(owner,status)/
  RespawnFlag (asks the briefcase to re-drop, never walks home)/Destroy/PlayerTakeFlag(=Use=WaitTouch:
  enemy→pickup, own dropped→return +5)/CanInteract/ObjectCaps(0x10)/CanUsedTroughWalls(0). Thrown-flag
  momentum TakeDamage in Fall. Extracted to a HEADER (fixes the audit .h-only blind spot; lets
  briefcase/gamerules derive it).
- **Wiring:** DropFlag(false) from PlayerKilled / StartObserver / ClientDisconnect / TSDropWeapon;
  RestartRound clears carried flags (DropFlag(true)) + RespawnEntities now calls CTSFlag::RespawnFlag
  (was a VERIFY `Spawn()`). Removed the obsolete `tsspawnflag` console stand-in.
- **Metrics:** invented methods **117 → 110**, 0 missing / 0 invented classes, file mismatches 22.
- **⚠ SCORING corrects the early handoff note:** capture = **+10** frags (CaptureTouch); returning
  your own dropped flag = **+5** (PlayerTakeFlag). VERIFY slices: alive-drop toss speed (200), the
  exact CaptureTouch team-score field (used m_teamScore), s_flag_status @+0x254 base-spawn field.
- **UNPLAYTESTED** — the whole CTF flow needs a live pass before merge (with the rest of cont.74/75).

### CTSGun tail — SAFE chunk (30/47 -> 35/47), commit `966df00`
Driven by a fresh dossier subagent (`scratchpad/dossier-CTSGun-tail.md`; the prior name-map was lost with
the session scratchpad). **Core finding: the original CTSGun does NOT override `ItemPostFrame`** — it uses
the stock `CBasePlayerWeapon::ItemPostFrame` which dispatches to the real virtual entry points
(Primary/Secondary/Reload/WeaponIdle/Holster + helpers). Our reconstruction collapsed all that into one
invented `ItemPostFrame`, so the 17 "missing" methods are mostly **structural extraction**, not new behaviour.
- **Reset @0x705e0** (genuinely missing): wipe the whole arsenal (items[]/m_ammoReserve) + active pointers +
  combo/timer/change-detect cache back to bare kung-fu. Wired into Spawn (preserving the placed type across
  the wipe) + CBasePlayer::StartObserver (the round-restart / death->spectate caller @0x8972b). SAFE, server-only.
- **4 name-map renames** (coverage matches by NAME; zero behaviour change): AddWeapon->TakeWeapon, DropType->
  DropWeapon, SelectWeaponType->SelectWeapon, CloseCombatAttack->CCombatAttack. The free `TSSelectWeaponType`
  is preserved (word-boundary `\b` sed protects the TS-prefixed name).
- **⚠ The CTSGun TAIL IS PLAYTEST-GATED** (the `predicted-weapon-gotchas` rule — I did NOT push these):
  SecondaryAttack (right-click dispatch), the 2-stage grenade pull-pin/release model (our instant `GrenadeThrow`
  is wrong — biggest behaviour change), predicted melee KnifeFire/KatanaFire/KatanaThrow (split MeleeAttack/
  ThrowKnife), Holster/HolsterWeapon/ReloadWeapon/StopReload/EmptySound/CCombatIdle extraction, and the eventual
  ItemPostFrame revert-to-stock. The dossier has the per-method SAFE-vs-GATED table + the live test each needs.
  Group-D KEEP glue: CanDeploy/Get+SetWeaponData/OwnedCount/SlotsUsed/RegenBlockBar/Sync+LoadActiveFromItem/
  UpdateActivePointers/SendWeaponStatus/SwitchBarrel.

### Header-extraction batch — close the audit `.h`-blind-spot member gaps, commits `0990cfb`/`9e769ba`/`0ce095f`
`audit.py our_members()` scans only `.h`, so a class declared in a `.cpp` falsely reports ALL members MISSING
(memory `audit-py-blind-spots`). Extracting to a header is the FAITHFUL fix (the originals have headers; it also
lets sibling files derive the class — same as cont.74 did for CTSObjective/CTSWorldGun). Extracted +
member-name-matched: **CTSPowerUp** (ts_powerup.h; +preserved the TS_PWUP_INSTANT/ARMOR defines), **CTSDMHill**,
**CTSSlowMotion** (renamed m_flDuration->duration, m_flSlowAmount->slow_ammount to the orig FGD/save names —
kept the orig "ammount" typo), **CTSSlowMotionPoint**, **CTSBomb**, **CTSTeamEscape**, and the ts_objectives.cpp
trio **CTSHack** (ts_hack.h; hacksec) + **CTSWinGiver/CTSScoreGiver** (ts_wingiver.h; winnerteam/cash_for_winner/
cash_for_loser/numberofcall). All now `MISSING named: —`.

### Genuine missing-method/member RE (re.sh, not just extraction), commit `97058af` + `1332b9c`
With the `re` Ghidra lock free (dossiers done), decompiled + closed real gaps myself:
- **CVipEscape 1/3 -> 3/3** (`97058af`): added KeyValue (@0x8d22c — handles no keys, does NOT chain to base) +
  Precache (empty) + reconciled Spawn to the RE (EF_NODRAW/flags=0/classname/Precache/unconditional SET_MODEL);
  moved methods out-of-line so the audit attributes the file.
- **CTSMapGlobals 5/7 -> 7/7** (`97058af`): extracted to ts_mapglobals.h + added the 2 saved members
  player_at_a_time_num(@0xc)/player_respawn_num(@0x10) + Save/Restore (WriteFields 2) + m_SaveData; Spawn zeroes
  them + schedules WaitThink. ⚠ The spawnflags->CTSGameRules weapon-restriction/round-timer/superjump wiring is a
  documented SLICE (needs unbuilt CTSGameRules members @+0x586c/0x5870/0x10) — `members-globals` flag for later.
- **CTSKnife 3/9 -> 8/9** (`1332b9c`): ADDITIVE only (the thrown-knife flight/settle is playtest-confirmed,
  cont.69 knife->glass). Added GetDescription (@0x6db04, name by type)/ObjectCaps(0x10)/ShouldCollide(true, TS
  virtual)/Use (@0x6dda4, +use pickup mirroring our PickupTouch TSPickUpWeapon) + renamed the static factory
  Throw->CreateKnife (@0x6d9e4). ⚠ REMAINING PLAYTEST-GATED: WaitTouch (settle velocity-damp) + dissolving the
  invented settle helpers (BecomePickup/SettleThink/StartSettle/StickAt/PickupTouch/Classify) into the orig
  WaitTouch/Use structure.

⚠ **Remaining .cpp-only no-named-gap extractions** (low value — count only): CTSFog (0/0), CTSCustomTarget (0/10
but MISSING named: —). Genuine remaining gaps are stock-SDK classes (out of policy: CBaseDoor/CFuncPlat/CLadder/
CTriggerPush/CMultiManager keep their stock surface) and the big CBasePlayer method set (many playtest-gated).
- Metrics across the session: invented methods **117 -> 105**, 0 missing / 0 invented classes; many member-name
  gaps closed; all commits build `scripts/build.sh amd64 [all]` clean (glibc 2.14). 11 commits this session.

### STOCK-SDK class gaps — closed + match-verified (user: "let's get it there" + "confirm match vs rewritten")
A dossier subagent (`scratchpad/dossier-stock-gaps.md`) classified the 24 stock-class gaps the audit reports
(FALSE-INLINE/INHERITED vs REAL-TS-ADD) + spot-checked our existing impls for principle-match. Then I closed
the real ones:
- **CBaseEntity 72->80** (`50a6963`): the slow/collide/respawn methods are **base CBaseEntity virtuals** in the
  original (nm shows W defaults + T overrides) — we only had scattered derived overrides. Added the base virtuals
  (GiveSlowMul/GoSlow/InSlow/CanUsedTroughWalls/ShouldCollide/BreakableRespawn/OnFreeEntPrivateData/eoffset; base
  slow store = pev->fuser1), same pattern as cont.74's IsObjective/EnableObjective. Wired the per-entity
  OnFreeEntPrivateData hook. Client vtable stubs (GoSlow/InSlow/eoffset). Remaining 5 = inline accessors (false).
- **CBasePlayerWeapon 30->32** (`6b722f3`): base virtuals AddWeapon(){ExtractAmmo;return true;} + empty
  AlternateAttack() (CTSGun overrides). **CFuncPlat 12->15**: targettop/targetbot (FGD-confirmed) + KeyValue +
  Save/Restore; HitTop/HitBottom fire them (verified @0xc2d50/@0xc2bc0). **CHalfLifeMultiplay::IsValidTeam**
  (@0x7b140): blacklist the reserved HL model names.
- **Breakable doors CBaseDoor 15->17 + CRotDoor 2->3** (`c3960d8`): the biggest real-TS-add. TraceAttack (@0xb57ac)
  accumulate->shatter (glass=gmsgTSCreateDebris shower, else TE_BREAKMODEL, reusing CBreakable helpers) + kill +
  respawn; BreakableRespawn (@0xb5604) box-clear restore, CRotDoor override restores angles only. KeyValues
  maxdamage/doormaterial/respawntime. SLICE: respawn via the door's own RespawnThink (the 1 invented method) vs the
  orig's EHANDLE helper. **UNPLAYTESTED — doors break/respawn across every map; needs a live pass.**
- **DIVERGENCE RESOLVED — GetGameDescription** (`7374852`): verified (@0xc0c68) the original is on
  **CHalfLifeMultiplay** (theOne->LMS->DM, **NO teamplay branch**), CTSGameRules inherits (no override). Ours was a
  rewrite (teamplay-FIRST, on CTSGameRules). Relocated to CHalfLifeMultiplay + dropped the teamplay branch. Behavior
  change: team maps no longer show "(Teamplay)" (now faithful). CHalfLifeMultiplay 52->54; CTSGameRules invented 106->105.
- **Confirmed FALSE (no action, match-verified):** CMultiManager IsClone/ShouldClone (match), CLadder/CTriggerPush
  KeyValue (inherited base), CHalfLifeMultiplay::GetNextBestWeapon (inherited CGameRules, matches in principle),
  CBaseEntity edict/entindex/Instance/GetMonsterPointer/IsLockedByMaster (inline). 17 commits this session.

## 2026-06-28 (cont. 74) — source-parity restructure cont.: drifted classes' MISSING methods (+drop keepalives)

Branch `restructure-source-parity` (continues cont.73; GPG signing OFF). Same loop: `audit.py <Class>` ->
subagent dossier (`re.sh`, single-writer) -> reconcile our working logic into the original's exact method/
member layout -> `build.sh amd64 all` -> `audit.py <Class>` (0/0) -> commit. **User sharpened the directive:
ANY missing/extra member or global = hidden logic inconsistency -> re-audit + Ghidra, never paper over** (saved
as memory `members-globals-signal-hidden-logic`). Each class drops a keepalive by building real wiring.

- **CTSWorldGun cluster 4/13+3/7 -> 13/13+7/7** (`0df448f`): merged ts_ammopack.cpp INTO ts_worldgun.cpp
  (+new ts_worldgun.h) = TS_worldgun.cpp file parity (mismatch -1). **CTSWorldGun now derives CTSPhysicObject**
  (dossier confirmed; hierarchy.tsv MISSES it). Replaced invented FallThink with the real method split:
  CreateWeapon (static factory carrying the full s_weapon_status = our **TSItem**, the 0x38-byte slot) / Spawn
  (MOVETYPE_BOUNCE, gravity 0.7/friction 0.8) / BounceTouch (drop sound + 0.7 restitution) / Fall (settle +
  swept-trace impact damage — a thrown gun hurts what it flies into) / WaitThink / OnGround / Use (cooldown-gated)
  / GetWeapon (restores the full item to the arsenal) / WaitTouch / ShouldCollide (collide only vs WorldGun/knife,
  pass through players) / ObjectCaps / CanUsedTroughWalls. classname **"WorldGun"** (NOT ts_worldgun — fixed
  ts_sellzone match). Global **ShouldCollide hook wired into gNewDLLFunctions (pfnShouldCollide)**. CTSAmmoPack:
  carries **ARMOR** (pev->armorvalue via CBasePlayer::TakeArmor, removal keyed on armor==0); ammo via CTSGun::
  AddAmmo; classname "AmmoPack". Drop helpers in ts_gun.cpp guarded `#ifndef CLIENT_DLL`; carry the full TSItem.
  CTSPhysicObject now kept by CTSWorldGun (grenade keepalive slimmed). **CTSPhysicObject's curated trio
  (m_flExpire@0x88/m_pOwner@0x8c/m_iType@0xa0) is a curator MIS-HOIST** — they're grenade-subclass members that
  COLLIDE with CTSWorldGun's 0x88/0x8c; do NOT add to the base (verified via decompile, not the label).
- **CM61Grenade 0/6 -> 6/6** (`2dffd07`): was structurally off (derived stock CGrenade w/ invented Throw()+
  M61WaitThink()); real chain is **CM61Grenade : CTSGrenade : CTSPhysicObject**. Real 6 methods: CreateGrenade
  (static; propagates the thrower's slow-mo via fuser1=m_flSlowMotionGo) / Spawn / WaitThink (fuse += GiveSlowMul
  ()*0.1 = our existing max(fuser1,0.01)*0.1; 64u swept break-through; CTSPhysicObject::WaitThink upkeep; detonate)
  / BounceTouch (owner-skip -> CTSGrenade::BounceTouch) / Use (+USE re-throw at 625 u/s) / ObjectCaps (0x10).
  Removed invented avelocity tumble; added the missing CTSPhysicObject::WaitThink call. **DROPPED the
  ts_grenades_keep_physic keepalive** (CTSGrenade now kept via CM61Grenade inheritance). TSThrowM61 lost its
  damage param (orig carries none); blast dmg/radius fixed in WaitThink (VERIFY: recovered literals 300/1024 vs
  old tuned 400). Client stub updated; obsolete TSCreateWorldGun/TSCreateAmmoPack stubs removed.

- **CBreakable 17/22 -> 22/22** (`d63559d`): the TS breakable-RESPAWN system, all additive in tails so the
  playtest-confirmed glass/debris (gmsgTSCreateDebris) Die path is untouched. **Killed** override (records attacker
  global -> Die; TakeDamage now calls Killed ALONE — was Killed+Die, would double-Die). **BreakableRespawn(bool)**
  (@0x64e84): box-clear retry (UTIL_EntitiesInBox FL_CLIENT|FL_MONSTER) -> clear: restore deadflag/health/effects +
  Spawn (+fire respawntarget on SF 8); blocked: re-arm helper +5s; disabled: SUB_Remove. Spawn creates+cross-links
  the **CInfoBreakable** helper when respawntime>=0; Die's tail hides it (EF_NODRAW) + arms helper.RespawnThink at
  time+respawntime (0=>30s). New members m_flRespawnHealth/m_hRespawner/m_flRespawnTime/m_szRespawnTarget (not saved,
  matching orig); keyvalues respawntime/respawntarget. **CInfoBreakable: added LINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS(info_breakable)**
  (Create now resolves), RespawnThink fixed to just delegate to BreakableRespawn(false) (was wrongly resetting+Spawn+
  removing itself — the helper PERSISTS). **DROPPED ts_func_break_keep keepalive.** Moved stock Explodable/Explosion
  Magnitude/ExplosionSetMagnitude out-of-line (orig has real symbols) so audit sees them.

- **CTSGun 28/47 -> 30/47** (`a6a2669`,`<chunk3a>`): started the big name-map restructure of the central
  (client-predicted, heavily-playtested) weapon class in SAFE chunks, driven by the name-map dossier
  (`scratchpad/dossier-CTSGun-namemap.md` — the OUR->REAL map + groups A/B/C/D + chunk order). Chunk 1: pure
  rename CloseCombatBlock->CCombatBlock. Chunk 2: added the 2 missing NAMED members m_pActiveItem(+0xcc)/
  m_pActiveInfo(+0xd0) (kept in sync by UpdateActivePointers() at every m_weaponType assignment; the orig's
  `m_pActiveItem!=NULL` guard == our `m_weaponType!=TSW_MELEE`). Chunk 3a: ShouldWeaponIdle override (return true).
  **⚠ NEXT chunks are BLOCKED (assessed via the captured decompiles g1/g2/g3.c — NOT safe-additive):**
  Reset@0x805e0 needs a call site in CTSGameRules round/spawn-reset (UNBUILT) else it DCE's = dead/still-missing;
  CCombatIdle@0x85e54 plays `get_weapon_info(0)->[wi+0x252]` (the active-anim-block idle index) which our modern
  s_weapon_info doesn't carry — needs the weapon-table data extraction to avoid GUESSING the seq; EmptySound@0x71be4
  plays a predicted client event (field_0x968) — needs the event registered + client handler; HolsterWeapon@0x85698
  + chunk-4 DropType->DropWeapon/SelectWeaponType->SelectWeapon move Deploy out to EVERY caller of the playtested
  weapon-switch flow — a reshape that wants a playtest to verify. So CTSGun's tail needs groundwork first:
  (a) the weapon-table anim-block extraction, (b) CTSGameRules' reset path, and/or (c) a playtest budget — do those
  BEFORE resuming, rather than guess/dead-method. Chunk 6 (melee split KnifeFire/KatanaFire/KatanaThrow + the
  SecondaryAttack keystone + StopReload/ReloadWeapon, then dissolve invented ItemPostFrame) is the deepest, last.
  Group D KEEP (legit, not drift): CanDeploy/GetWeaponData/SetWeaponData (stock virtuals), OwnedCount/SlotsUsed/
  Sync+LoadActiveFromItem/RegenBlockBar/SwitchBarrel/SendWeaponStatus/UpdateActivePointers (model glue).

- **CTSPowerUp 11/11 0-invented** (`3f81e4a`) + **CTSSlowMotionPoint 4/5->5/5** + **CTSBriefcase 6/6 0-invented**
  (`5e56977`): a batch of clean small-class reconciles. **Reusable pattern found — INVENTED `ObjectCaps`:** several
  TS classes override ObjectCaps where the ORIGINAL has none (uses base) — confirm via decompile (the method count
  excludes ObjectCaps), then REMOVE ours (the FCAP_ACROSS_TRANSITION/DONT_SAVE difference is inert for runtime-created
  or MP-only entities). Did CTSPowerUp (return ~ACROSS_TRANSITION), CTSSlowMotionPoint, CTSBriefcase (return
  FCAP_DONT_SAVE). Also: CTSSlowMotionPoint Create->CreateSlowMotionPoint (name match); CTSPowerUp members
  m_iType/m_iRespawnTime/m_flMult -> poweruptype/pwupduration/pwupmult (the orig FGD/save names, offsets already matched).
  ⚠ **TOOLING BLIND SPOT found:** `audit.py our_members()` only scans **.h files** — so for classes declared in a .cpp
  (CTSPowerUp/CTSFlag/CTSSlowMotionPoint/CTSBriefcase/…) it reports "0 ours / MISSING named: <all>" REGARDLESS of our
  member names. Those member "gaps" are FALSE — verify by reading the .cpp. (Fix would be teaching our_members to
  brace-track + scan .cpp, but that risks misparsing .cpp locals — left as a tooling follow-up.)
- **CTSDMHill 3/7->7/7** (`179777b`): reshaped our think-poll (invented HillThink+Award) to the original's
  TOUCH-driven king-of-the-hill — WaitTouch (holder tracking: first toucher claims; same-team keeps; enemy resets;
  payout past the award time, team mode awards every teammate) + WaitThink (reschedule) + Save/Restore + members
  renamed nextcheck/fragseverycheck(kv fragamt)/fragseverycheckteam(kv fragamtteam). ObjectCaps->0.
- **CTSObjective 1/7->7/7** (`b878bb9`): the objectives-cluster BASE. CanInteract(CBasePlayer*)/(int) + Freeze
  (out-of-line) + IsObjective()->true + EnableObjective(bool) + Save/Restore (1-field=attacker_team). Freeze's
  CTSGameRules::ShowObjectiveOnHud stays SLICE (unbuilt). **⚠ STRUCTURAL finding:** the original objectives cluster
  (CTSBomb/CTSHack/CTSTeamEscape) DERIVES CTSObjective; OURS has each CBaseEntity-direct with DUPLICATED attacker_team/
  CanInteract. Cluster reconcile = make them derive CTSObjective + build CTSGameRules' objective methods they call —
  a multi-class job interdependent with CTSGameRules 12/39. Decompiles captured: scratchpad/obj.c, hill.c.
- **Objectives-cluster restructure STARTED** (`c5fe12d`,`419422b`): **extracted CTSObjective into dlls/ts_objectives.h**
  so the per-objective classes in their own .cpp can DERIVE it (also makes CTSObjective's members header-visible →
  audit no longer false-flags them). **CTSBomb 9/11->11/11**: derives CTSObjective (drops dup m_attackerTeam/CanInteract;
  m_bEnabled->inherited m_bActive); +Save/Restore (2-field=defusesec/cancutwire); members renamed
  defusetime->defusesec/cutwires->cancutwire; dissolved invented Explode inline into WaitThink. **CTSTeamEscape
  5/9->9/9**: derives CTSObjective; +Save/Restore (1-field=escape_percentage)+Precache(empty)+ObjectCaps(0x10);
  dissolved invented AttackerTeamSize inline; completion uses Freeze(true). **PATTERN for the cluster:** derive
  CTSObjective, drop the duplicated attacker_team/CanInteract, map the class's "enabled" flag to the inherited
  m_bActive(+0x64), add Save/Restore via IMPLEMENT_SAVERESTORE(<Class>, CTSObjective), rename members to the
  FGD/save names, dissolve invented helpers the original inlines. **CTSHack 4/9->9/9 DONE (448d27d): Use-driven held-USE hack (m_flHackProgress from hacksec) + WaitThink objective deadline (m_flObjTimer seeded from m_flRoundEnd) + EnableObjective/ObjectCaps/Save/Restore; dissolved invented HackTouch. ALL 4 core cluster classes (CTSObjective/CTSBomb/CTSTeamEscape/CTSHack) DONE.
  **CLUSTER BOUNDARY:** the WIRING classes are BLOCKED on CTSGameRules' unbuilt objective methods — CTSObjectivePointer::Use
  (only-missing) finds the targeted objective, EnableObjective(true)s it, then needs CTSGameRules::AddObjectiveInList +
  SendObjectiveToHud(idx,player) per client (both unbuilt). CTSObjectiveManager (Save/Restore + targets[8]/messages[4]/
  end_round_target) + CTSWinGiver (EnableObjective/IsObjective/Save/Restore + cash_for_winner/loser/numberofcall/winnerteam)
  remain; their HUD/list flow also needs the CTSGameRules objective subsystem (AddObjectiveInList/SendObjectiveToHud/
  SendObjectiveList/ShowObjectiveOnHud/SetObjective/InitObjectives + TeamWin). DO THAT SUBSYSTEM NEXT (part of CTSGameRules
  12/39), then Pointer::Use/Manager/WinGiver wire up. Decompile: scratchpad/ptruse.c.
- **CTSGameRules objective subsystem DONE (68fba35): 12/39 -> 20/39.** Built the 8 methods + 2 gmsgs (dossier
  scratchpad/dossier-gr-objectives.md): HUD list (m_objectiveList[32] of {CTSObjective*+per-team label string-idx}+count) —
  ClearObjectiveList/FindIndexByObjective/AddObjectiveInList/SendObjectiveToHud('Objective' -1: coord xyz+byte idx+string
  label, MSG_ONE)/SendObjectiveList/ShowObjectiveOnHud('ShowObj' 2: byte idx+byte show, MSG_ALL); manager array
  (m_managers[32]) — InitObjectives(scan ts_objective_manager + disable objectives by classname)/SetObjective(random manager
  +Reset). Extracted CTSObjectiveManager into ts_objectives.h. **UN-SLICED CTSObjective::Freeze -> ShowObjectiveOnHud** (the
  cluster's freeze/complete now updates the HUD). ⚠ **TWO BLOCKERS for the rest of the wiring:** (1) the original's
  IsObjective is a CBaseEntity virtual (every entity answers it) — OURS is CTSObjective-only, so you can't call
  ->IsObjective() on an arbitrary found entity (InitObjectives works around it by enumerating objective CLASSNAMES;
  CTSObjectivePointer::Use finds by targetname so it can't). (2) CTSObjectivePointer::Use reads the objective via
  *(CTSObjective**)(found+0x7c) — UNCERTAIN field. To finish Pointer::Use/Manager/WinGiver: either add IsObjective() to
  CBaseEntity (faithful — orig has it at vtbl 0x1c; verify audit doesn't flag invented) or classname-gate, AND RE the +0x7c
  ref (live trace/decompile). Remaining CTSGameRules gap (19): voting/team-cash/round-restart/TheOne subsystems.
- **OBJECTIVES CLUSTER COMPLETE (5609490, 88d29fa).** Added IsObjective()/EnableObjective() as CBaseEntity virtuals
  (the original has them — IsObjective__11CBaseEntity/EnableObjective__11CBaseEntityb, audit listed both MISSING on
  CBaseEntity; default false/no-op, CTSObjective-derived override) -> CBaseEntity 70->72/85. Solved Pointer::Use's
  *(CTSObjective**)(found+0x7c) = the found edict's pvPrivateData = CBaseEntity::Instance (the found ent IS the
  objective). CTSObjectivePointer 2/3->3/3 (Use: per targeted IsObjective() ent -> EnableObjective(true) +
  AddObjectiveInList(obj, the pointer's 4 per-team labels) + SendObjectiveToHud to all). InitObjectives now does the
  faithful all-entity IsObjective() sweep. **CTSObjectiveManager 5/5** (+Save/Restore 13-field=8 targets+4 messages+
  end_round_target; members renamed m_objTargets->targets/m_messages->messages/m_targetTimeLeft->end_round_target).
  **CTSWinGiver 7/7** (+Save/Restore 4-field=winnerteam/cash_for_winner/cash_for_loser/numberofcall + IsObjective()->1
  + EnableObjective override [orig ignores arg, just resets]; members renamed). Whole cluster (CTSObjective base +
  Bomb/TeamEscape/Hack/Trigger/WinGiver/ScoreGiver derive it w/ Save/Restore; Manager/Pointer wire the HUD; CTSGameRules
  8 methods + Objective/ShowObj gmsgs) reconstructed end-to-end. ⚠ CLIENT HUD handler for Objective/ShowObj = cl_dll track.
  Still OPEN (not blocking): the array-element audit-naming artifact on Manager targets[]/messages[] (DEFINE_ARRAY vs
  per-element — data saves fine).
- **CTSGameRules round-restart subsystem DONE (0a7832c): 20/39 -> 25/39** (dossier scratchpad/dossier-roundrestart.md).
  Reshaped our static TSRestartRound into the original's methods + WIRED InitObjectives/SetObjective into the round
  lifecycle (retiring the cluster's Spawn-self-arm SLICE intent): **Init()** (+a CTSGameRules ctor calling it: InitTeams +
  InitObjectives->SetObjective + m_flRoundRestart=time+5 + round-timer-enabled); **RestartRound()** (re-arm timer inline
  [roundtime clamp 30..180] + disarm restart + RoundTime msg + InitObjectives->SetObjective + team banner + respawn players
  + RecountTeams + RespawnEntities(true); now the member called from Think); **RespawnEntities(bool)** (info_breakable->
  RespawnThink + ts_flag always; ts_groundweapon->Fall team/lms; ts_powerup lms — VERIFY: powerup/flag use Spawn() vs orig
  Fall/RespawnFlag since those classes are .cpp-local); **ResetRestartRound(int)** (round-end arm-1s-restart, team/lms-gated,
  +"Restarting Round", depth>1 wipes scores — TeamWin now calls it instead of an inline +3s); **CountPlayers()**. Made
  ts_groundweapon.h self-contained. SLICEs: RestartRound's loadout cash-refund + force-class-select-observer (we respawn
  directly); ResetRestartRound's per-team cash reset + TeamScore broadcast.
- **CTSGameRules team-cash/list subsystem DONE (6c9cbe2): 25/39 -> 31/39.** Added GetTeamsNum (active-team count),
  SetTeamList (parse ';'-list -> roster + RecountTeams), SetTeamModelList (parse '|'-list + the per-slot (int,model)
  overload), GetTeamCash (player's team-pool cash; the cash economy is hard-OFF so returns 0), and InitTeamScore/
  UpdateTeamScores (**NO-OP stubs in the original**). Added m_teamCash[]. InitTeams now drives SetTeamList/SetTeamModelList;
  the rest wired to faithful callers (GetTeamsNum->InitHUD, GetTeamCash->PlayerSpawn[inert@0], InitTeamScore->Init,
  UpdateTeamScores->ResetRestartRound) so --gc-sections keeps them.
- **CTSGameRules COMPLETE — 39/39 methods, 0 missing (b48ecbf/92256db/cc7059b).** Finished the last 3 subsystems:
  **TheOne juggernaut** (IsCTB[ts_briefcase cache]/SelectRandomTheOne[throttled crown]/SetPlayerTheOne[buff: health 150+
  regen+kungfu+low-grav+maxspeed 330]/TheOneIsDead[killer inherits]; +CBasePlayer m_bTheOne; wired Think+PlayerKilled);
  **GetPlayerModel**(random team model, wired AssignToTeam) + **TogglePlayerFromSlow**(GoSlow(1,0), wired PlayerKilled);
  **voting** (PlayerVote['vote reset|stats|map <name>', IS_MAP_VALID] + CheckVotes[10s tally of map/ff/teamplay votes ->
  majority=CalcMiniminVotants=max(votants/2,1) -> mp_friendlyfire/mp_teamplay/next-map]; wired ClientCommand 'vote' + Think).
  CTSGameRules went **12/39 -> 39/39 this session** via 5 subsystems (objective, round-restart, team-cash/list, TheOne,
  voting). The 12 "invented" methods are legit: stock virtual overrides (PlayerKilled/PlayerSpawn) + TS team helpers
  (AssignToTeam/IsTeamMode/GetIndexedTeamName/GetTeamID/RecountTeams/etc.) under our reconstruction names. SLICEs noted in
  commits (cash refund/observer, ff/teamplay vote commands, next-map application, the_one powerup value). UNPLAYTESTED.
  derives CTSObjective; needs +Save/Restore(hacksec)+EnableObjective+ObjectCaps(0x10) and to dissolve our invented
  HackTouch into the original's **Use** (a 688-byte hack-interaction method) + the WaitThink countdown-to-Freeze model
  (EnableObjective seeds field_0x6c timer; WaitThink decrements each sec -> Freeze(true) at 0). Decompile: scratchpad/hack.c.

audit headline: invented methods **131->117**, file mismatches **23->22**, 0 missing/0 invented classes; **3
keepalives dropped/slimmed** (CTSPhysicObject now kept by CTSWorldGun, CTSGrenade by CM61Grenade, CInfoBreakable
wired+LINK'd). Remaining keepalive: the compiled-but-unlinked pistols (CTSPistolWeapon/Ammo — the ORIGINAL keeps
them too, legit). All build amd64 server+client (glibc 2.14). **⚠ ALL UNPLAYTESTED** — bounce physics, swept impact
damage, armor drop, grenade slow-mo + M61 blast literals, breakable respawn. NEXT: the **CTF cluster** (deferred —
bottom-up: s_flag_status -> CBasePlayer::TakeFlag/DropFlag -> CTSBriefcase -> CTSFlag 4/15; dossier
`scratchpad/dossier-CTSFlag.md`), CTSGameRules 12/39 + the objectives cluster, CTSGun's remaining missing methods,
the ~126 invented methods to review.

## 2026-06-28 (cont. 73) — code-restructure to source parity (audit.py-driven): 7 classes -> 1:1

Branch `restructure-source-parity`. Per the user's directive — ONE CLASS AT A TIME, make methods + variables
match the original 1:1 (nothing missing, nothing added), using subagents that write `.md` dossiers to scratchpad
(keep raw decompiles out of context). Loop: `re.sh <Class>` decompile -> dossier -> reconcile our WORKING logic into
the original's exact method/member layout -> build amd64 -> `audit.py <Class>` -> commit. Driver = `scripts/coverage/audit.py`.
GPG signing off for the session (`git config --local commit.gpgsign false`).

5 commits `69c21ab`..`8f73a46`. audit headline: invented methods **145->132**, file mismatches **25->22**,
0 invented classes (unchanged). Each builds amd64 (glibc 2.14); the BEHAVIOUR-sensitive ones need a playtest pass.

- **CTSAnimation 13/13** (`69c21ab`): split our monolithic `Animate()` + 4 collapsed helpers into the original's 13
  methods (Init/UpdateTimers/Animate 4-phase / Enable/Disable/BulletDance / BlendAnimationsForSlide/ByDir/Jump /
  SetAnim / HandleCloseCombat / IsInCloseCombat / GaitCloseCombat). `SetBodySequence`+`SetGaitSequence` -> the flag-driven
  `SetAnim` (orig flags 0x92/0x94/0x14/0x194/0x12). `GetMoveDirection` -> the free `GetDirection` (orig
  `GetDirection__FG6VectorT0ff`). `PlayKungFu` -> `HandleCloseCombat(player,code)`; ts_gun's 3 PlayKungFu(name) sites ->
  `Animate(player,closeCombatCode)`. `m_bKungFu` bool REMOVED — kung-fu keys off the EMPTY grip (melee Deploy now passes
  ""; also fixes the phantom `draw_onehanded` pistol-draw on fists). Added bullet-dance state + GiveSlowMul timer scaling.
- **CTSStunt 25/25** (`000f2a3`): the 5 INVENTED helpers leave the class surface — `GetDirection` = the shared free fn;
  `TimeScale`/`SendNextStunt`/`MotionBlur`/`ResetStuntState` -> file-local statics (the original inlines them; like the
  existing TSWallTrace). `SlotBonus`/`NextDive` out-of-line. `CloseAttack` (the JUMP-KICK <- CBasePlayer::Jump)
  reconstructed AS a CTSStunt method — relocated from the free fn `TSTryJumpKick` (removed; invented-global cleared;
  `m_flNextJumpKick` member removed, uses `m_flStunCooldown`=CTSStunt+8). `CheckForBreakables` (<- PreThink) added: the
  non-melee run/dive-into sweep shatters world breakables (players excluded; the close-combat Victim*Hold path needs unbuilt
  state -> DEFERRED+VERIFY). `TimeScale` fixed to `max(fuser1,0.01)`. A caller-finder subagent (`re.sh refs`/`vrefs`)
  confirmed: CheckForBreakables<-PreThink, CloseAttack<-Jump; the +0xb4 damage-virtual + GetDirection's networked +0x2a0
  store are VERIFY-flagged.
- **CTSDeadCorpse 5/5 + file rename** (`683c123`): FadeThink->WaitThink; add empty Precache + no-op TraceAttack;
  ObjectCaps -> FCAP_DONT_SAVE (0x80000000). `ts_corpse.cpp` -> **`ts_deadcorpse.cpp`** (LINK name `ts_corpse` unchanged).
- **CTSShrapnel 6/6 + file rename** (`feb4e02`): FadeThink->WaitThink. `ts_grenade.cpp` -> **`ts_grenades.cpp`** (also
  clears CM61Grenade's file-mismatch — shares the file; CM61Grenade methods still drift, separate pass).
- **CTSPlayerAmount 4/4** (`8f73a46`): event-driven `ClientConnect`/`ClientDisconnect` (per-entity counter, fire on
  ==clients) replace the invented `CountThink` poll + `CountConnectedPlayers`; derive CBaseDelay; wired from the engine
  ClientConnect/Disconnect hooks in client.cpp (new ts_playeramount.h). (File still ts_playeramount.cpp vs the original's
  grouped TS_entities.cpp — grouping divergence, per HANDOFF.)
- **CTSTrigger 5/5 + CTSScoreGiver 3/3** (`887c58f`): CTSTrigger += ObjectCaps()=0 + WaitThink (reschedule, wired in
  Spawn). CTSScoreGiver += explicit KeyValue (delegates to CTSWinGiver) + Spawn (hidden relay). NB the objectives cluster
  (CTSObjective/CTSObjectiveManager/CTSObjectivePointer/CTSHack/CTSWinGiver + CTSGameRules' AddObjectiveInList/
  SendObjectiveToHud/TeamWin) is INTERDEPENDENT — CTSObjectivePointer::Use etc. are blocked on the missing CTSGameRules
  objective methods, so that cluster wants doing together (CTSGameRules first).

**File-name parity note** (user asked): `audit.py`'s `norm_file` strips the `ts_`/`TS_` prefix + drops `"manager"`, so
e.g. `ts_animation`≡`TS_animation`, `ts_stunt`≡`TS_stuntmanager` already report ✓. The 22 remaining FILE mismatches are
mostly the original GROUPING many classes into one `TS_*.cpp` (TS_entities/TS_objectives/TS_worldgun) vs our per-class
files — single-class renames are taken inline (corpse/grenades); the grouped merges are deferred per HANDOFF.

**Dossiers saved** (scratchpad, reusable): `dossier-hldmcompat.md` (the 18 missing weapon/ammo spawner classes — entity
name map + Random<X> sets; UNLINKED: CTSPistolWeapon/Ammo; do the CTSGroundWeapon/Ammo base FIRST). `dossier-CTSAnimation.md`,
`dossier-CTSStunt.md`, `dossier-CTSStunt-callers.md`.

### cont.73 cont. — worldgun/hldmcompat cluster (bottom-up): missing classes 24 -> 8

Per the refined goal (do dependencies first, ALL missing-class closures). Commits `875da11`..`86bfb6a`.

- **CTSGroundWeapon 5/14 -> 14/14** (`875da11`, header ts_groundweapon.h): full settle-then-pickup state machine
  (Spawn point-bbox -> Fall -> OnGround SOLID_TRIGGER grab box -> WaitTouch[0x1d auto / else USE] -> GetWeapon),
  Save/Restore + DEFINE_FIELD table (respawntime/tsweaponid/extraclip), ObjectCaps=FCAP_CONTINUOUS_USE,
  CanUsedTroughWalls()=0, virtual GetWeapon for subclasses. **audit.py our_members() fixed** to detect non-m_
  members (the original's FGD/save names are unprefixed) so faithfully-named members aren't falsely "missing".
- **CTSGroundWeapon buy gate** (`cb8330c`): the user flagged unused attackerteam/buyable = missing logic. RE:
  CashBased() is hard-OFF in the shipped game (cash economy compiled out) so the buy gate is DEAD in the original
  too — but PRESENT in GetWeapon. Restored it gated on CashBased() (team restriction + cash price via GiveCash);
  attackerteam/buyable/extraclip now consumed, 1:1. **LESSON: unused members => flag + fix immediately.**
- **10 weapon spawners** (`9d860be`, hldmcompat.cpp): 6 random (CTSPistol/BigPistol/Shotgun/Rifle/SMG/KnifeWeapon,
  Spawn+GetWeapon+RandomX) + 4 fixed (CTSSniper/MG/Katana/GrenadeWeapon, Spawn). Derive CTSGroundWeapon, remap
  stock HL weapon entity names. **Conflict resolved:** the stock SDK LINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS lines (weapon_shotgun/
  gauss/egon/rpg/crossbow/hornetgun/snark/satchel/handgrenade/9mmAR/ammo_ARgrenades) commented out across 10
  stock weapon files (the original has no stock HL weapons); stock CLASSES stay compiled (hgrunt->CShotgun,
  client->CRpg). No effect on TS maps; stock maps now spawn TS weapons.
- **CTSGroundAmmo 9/11 -> 11/11 + 6 ammo spawners** (`07067a6`, header ts_groundammo.h): m_ammo[16] caliber-indexed
  array (calibers reach 13); CTSPistol/BigPistol/Rifle/SMG/Shotgun/SniperAmmo derive it (RE: CTSBigPistolAmmo::Spawn
  = CTSGroundAmmo::Spawn + m_ammo[5]/[11]). Stock ammo LINKs commented too. ammo amount = TSRoundsPerMag proxy (VERIFY
  the orig get_ammo_info(cal)->default/2).
- **Unlinked pistol keepalive** (`86bfb6a`): CTSPistolWeapon/CTSPistolAmmo are compiled-but-unlinked in the original;
  our --gc-sections DCE'd them -> an exported `hldmcompat_keep_unlinked()` anchor keeps them. 3/3 + 1/1.

### cont.73 cont.2 — more missing-class closures (bottom-up): missing classes 8 -> 5

- **CTSPhysicObject 5/5 + CTSGrenade 2/2** (`a5294db`, ts_physicobject.h): slow-motion physics base (velocity/
  avelocity/gravity scaled by fuser1 when slowed; save/restore; WaitThink toggles on fuser1<1 as the InSlow proxy)
  + the thin grenade subclass (grenbounce sounds + damp/settle). Kept via ts_grenades_keep_physic() until the
  grenade/worldgun hierarchy is rewired to derive them (CTSWorldGun:CTSPhysicObject + thrown grenades) — follow-up.
- **CBulletManager 6/6** (`3f77c1a`): our slow-bullet FREE functions (TSFireSlowBullet/Update/Reset) wrapped into the
  CBulletManager class (FireBullet/Reset/Think/UpdateBullet/UpdateBulletTimeSlice/DestroyBullet); 256-slot ring =
  m_bullets member; global g_BulletManager (orig embeds it in CTSGameRules+0x1864). Callers (ts_gun/ts_gamerules) updated.

**KEEPALIVE pattern** for compiled-but-unreferenced classes (the original keeps them; our --gc-sections drops them):
an exported, never-called function referencing static instances (`hldmcompat_keep_unlinked`, `ts_grenades_keep_physic`).
Honest stopgap until the real hierarchy/wiring is built; flagged in each.

### cont.73 cont.3 — ALL missing classes closed: 24 -> 0 ✅

- **Emitter cluster** (`6317297`): CTSSharedEmitter 10/10 (ts_sharedemitter.h, global s_Emitter + 2x512 arrays +
  the keyvalue parsers; most of the pipeline DEAD as shipped — reproduced inert) + CTSEmitter 4/4 (self-removes in
  Spawn) + CTSParticle 3/3 (registers + persists) + CTSWind 3/3 (BlowThink broadcasts gmsgTSParticleSystem subtype 3).
  gmsgTSParticleSystem (TSPSys,-1) registered; KillAll wired into ServerDeactivate. Client TSPSys decode = separate track.
- **CInfoBreakable** (`6eff724`): the breakable respawn retry-helper (1/1, ts_func_break.cpp). FOLLOW-UP (not wired —
  playtest-sensitive): CBreakable::BreakableRespawn (@0x74e84 box-clear retry) + Die creating/arming the helper +
  the respawn-time members. Kept via ts_func_break_keep() until then.

**🎯 ALL 24 originally-missing TS classes are CLOSED (24 -> 0).** audit.py headline: 0 missing / 0 invented classes.

**Remaining audit work** (drifted, not missing): ~131 "invented methods" to review (mostly legit SDK helpers on
CBasePlayer/CBaseEntity); the big drifted classes' MISSING methods (CTSGameRules 12/39, CTSGun 28/47, CM61Grenade,
CTSFlag, CTSWorldGun 4/13 -> rederive CTSPhysicObject, CBreakable 17/22 -> the breakable-respawn cluster above);
23 file mismatches (grouping divergence, mostly OK). KEEPALIVE'd classes (pistols, CTSPhysicObject/CTSGrenade,
CInfoBreakable) want their real hierarchy/wiring built to drop the anchors. **⚠ EVERYTHING this session is
UNPLAYTESTED** — the whole worldgun/hldmcompat/bullet/physics/emitter behaviour needs a playtest pass.

**(old NEXT, now done):** the emitter cluster — **CTSSharedEmitter (10-method particle manager) FIRST**, then
CTSEmitter/CTSParticle/CTSWind entities (TS_emitter.cpp; dossier-emitter.md). CInfoBreakable (1 method, created by
CBreakable::BreakableRespawn — do with the breakable-respawn drift). Then the big drifted classes (CTSGameRules 12/39,
CTSGun 28/47, CM61Grenade, CTSFlag, CTSWorldGun 4/13 -> rederive CTSPhysicObject), 131 invented methods to review, and
client-side structural parity (separate manual track). ⚠ The whole worldgun/hldmcompat/bullet/physics behaviour is
UNPLAYTESTED — needs a pass (stock-name weapon remap, pickup physics, slow-bullet, grenade bounce).

## 2026-06-28 (cont. 72) — RE-tooling pass: audit toolchain + deterministic inventory (committed); pump WIP

Built the machine-checkable RE inventory + bidirectional audit, made it deterministic, set up the Ghidra MCP.
10 commits `77cb586`→`1f839c8` on main. **NEXT: use audit.py to restructure our code to the original layout
(source parity).**

- **audit.py** — bidirectional ours-vs-original structure check against ts_inventory.json (file/class/method/
  member/global, MISSING + INVENTED). `audit.py <Class>` per-class; `--strict` CI gate; wired into run.py →
  AUDIT.md. Current: 24 missing classes, 0 invented classes, 145 invented methods (review), 211 missing methods,
  54 missing named members, 25 file mismatches, 24 missing globals. coverage.py still does the external contract.
- **vrefs.py** (`re.sh vrefs`) reverse virtual-call finder; **curate_members.py** producer for members_re.tsv
  (the orphan); **client_members.py** (binmap-match our client.so→client.dll + ApplyClientThis.java + DumpMembers)
  → members_auto_client.tsv (51 classes/1319 members incl. CHud*); **binmap.py** .so↔mp.dll/client matcher.
- **member-inventory completeness**: DumpMembers parses the opaque `*(t*)(this+0xNN)` form → recovers
  CTSGameRules/CTSStunt/CTSAnimation (860→1030/137). **s_weapon_info/s_weapon_status structs** applied (weapon
  code reads this->m_pActiveInfo->iFireType). **ts_inventory.json** now carries full per-class members (1402) +
  client skeleton.
- **DETERMINISM** (was wobbling run-to-run): cached single-threaded `re-base` (`re.sh analyze`, COPIED per setup,
  also faster) + `-max-cpu 1` (member SET) + CANONICAL type column in DumpMembers (Ghidra's decompiler integer-type
  inference is non-deterministic, unreachable by -max-cpu; float/double/ptr stable → presence-keyed, integers→int).
  Verified 0-diff. Diagnosed by measurement after 3 wrong hypotheses.
- **Ghidra MCP** front-end on the typed `re` project (CLAUDE.md §4a.3 + .lock gotcha; `[[ghidra-mcp-vs-own-tooling]]`;
  `scripts/ghidra/mcp-up.sh`).
- **Pump shotgun (COMMITTED `2b23000`+`9c3ec0c`, pushed)**: RE-confirmed HELD/auto-alternate (all 3 default to
  PUMP; ShotgunFire alternates fire/rack via item+0x24 = predicted m_fInSpecialReload; tap=one step). Rack sound
  CHAN_ITEM. Pump VKickback 0.35× (benelli/spas pump mode; mossberg full) — applied to the CLIENT aim-recoil
  (TS_AddViewRecoil), NOT server VKickback (RE @0x70414: punchangle is bots-only); the magnitude rides to the
  client via the fire-event fparam2. Playtest-confirmed.
- **Client-side architecture divergence noted (restructure)**: original splits the CLIENT fire path into
  per-fire-type handlers (FUN_10040c20 pump / FUN_1003f090 akimbo / FUN_1003dfa0 standard); we use ONE EV_TSFire.
  audit.py is SERVER-ONLY → won't catch client structural divergence; client parity is a separate manual track
  (dc.sh client + clientdll project). See HANDOFF cont.72.

## 2026-06-27 (cont. 71 cont.2) — long live-playtest pass: laser/HUD/muzzle/weapons + pump (in progress)

Marathon interactive session, user firing every change in graphical xash. Committed `8c27afa`→`0b45726` on main
(see HANDOFF "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ START HERE cont.71 cont." for the per-commit list). Highlights:
- **Lasersight**: local player's dot is a HUD dot (RE `FUN_1003d600` skips local; others get the world beam+dot);
  beam = `laserbeamanim.spr`; dot screenspace-anchored on the eye-ray (distance-independent, centred up close).
  Map-change persistence fixed (don't clear `g_playerAttach` on VidInit). Per-weapon attachment buy-binding fixed
  (interleaved tkw/tki). `useitems` = ATTACHMENT toggle (RE `FUN_0x71564`), akimbo swap = right-click.
- **Viewmodel aims UP with ground move speed** (cl_dll/view.cpp `V_CalcRefdef`) — for every weapon; the laser dot
  follows the model. Halved the figure-8 weapon sway. Flashlight = light-only + `flash.spr` on the gun, radius
  1.5×. Muzzle flash = `gun_muzzle.spr`(sil)/`gun_muzzle2.spr` for all weapons.
- **HUD**: numbers.spr digit font (health/powerup/bottom-box ammo/top-bar slots); bottom-box attachment list with
  item_installed/not_installed dots + lighter-background active highlight; melee BLOCK bar (gmsgKFuPower stamina,
  melee-only, fades to red).
- **Weapons**: katana right-click throw + stuck-katana NOT pickup-able + throw caps (knife 5/seal 10/katana 1);
  all melee block on RELOAD; weapon UNHOLSTER anim on switch (per-weapon draw-seq parsed from viewmodels +
  viewmodel-change replay force for same draw-index pairs); shotguns trace ALL pellets client-side (8 decals).
  Spectator top-left inset (pip) forced OFF.
- **RE-confirmed faithful (no change)**: UMP 2-round burst (`burst=(type!=0x17)+2`); double-fire = 1.5× (`*=1.5`).

🟡 **IN PROGRESS (uncommitted): pump-action shotgun.** Fire is now press-edge (one shot per pull) — WORKS. The
cosmetic RACK (pump anim+sound between shots) was reworked from a custom timer (failed: custom fields aren't
decremented in client prediction) to a `bool m_bNeedRack` + the predicted `m_flTimeWeaponIdle`; NOT yet
playtest-confirmed. ⚠️ Lesson (cost two regressions): NEVER gate the FIRE on non-predicted state (an `m_bPumped`
chamber state machine desynced → infinite-fire); keep pump cosmetics cosmetic. ALSO: ts_gun.cpp builds into BOTH
hl.so + client.so — always `build.sh amd64 all`, else the client predicts stale weapon logic. [[useitems-is-attachment-toggle]]

## 2026-06-26 (cont. 71 cont.) — HUD numbers + attachment toggle + katana + melee block bar (live-playtest pass)

Long interactive playtest pass, all RE-grounded + user-confirmed. Committed as a client/server pair
(cl_dll HUD presentation; dlls gameplay) on top of 8c27afa.

- **numbers.spr digit font** wired into: health number (ts_status), powerup seconds (ts_powerup_hud),
  bottom weapon-box ammo "clip / reserve" (ts_ammo, TSHud_DrawNumberPair with a slash), and the top
  weapon-bar slot numbers 1-5 (ts_weaponbar). Left as text: the top-bar cursor x/y (per user). Helpers
  TSHud_DrawNumber/NumberWidth/DrawNumberPair in ts_hud (font map sprites/hud.txt number_0..9, 11px).
- **`useitems` = ATTACHMENT TOGGLE** (NOT akimbo swap — user corrected; akimbo swap is right-click).
  RE'd FUN_0x71564: item +0x10 = EQUIPPED mask, +0x14 = ACTIVE mask. State machine (both laser+flash
  equipped): active cycles 6(both)->0(off)->2(laser)->4(flash)->6; one equipped toggles it. Rewrote
  CTSGun::SwitchItems to this; moved the akimbo barrel-swap to SecondaryAttack (right-click) as
  SwitchBarrel. AddItem starts new toggleables ACTIVE. Wire: ActItems now carries the ACTIVE mask (gates
  the laser beam render + dive-reticle distance); WeaponInfo flags byte carries the EQUIPPED mask. Bottom
  weapon-box restructured top->bottom (name/caliber/firemode/ammo/attachments/bar) listing each equipped
  attachment with a laserdot.spr dot, active ones bright. [[useitems-is-attachment-toggle]]
- **Katana right-click throw** (orig SecondaryAttack fire-type 10 -> KatanaThrow): generalized ThrowKnife
  for katana (katana/miss.wav) + routed it. **Stuck katanas NOT pickup-removable** (the pickup was our
  added nicety; original leaves a settled blade inert) — gated BecomePickup so a katana stays inert
  decoration; knives/seal keep the pickup. **Throw caps**: knife 5, seal-knife 10, katana 1 (ts_weapon_info).
- **Melee block bar** = MELEE BLOCK STAMINA (field_0x774), shown ONLY for melee weapons (kungfu/knife/
  katana/seal), NOT health, NOT on guns. RE CCombatBlock@0x85ebc + UpdateMeleeBar@0x9650c: ALL melee
  block on RELOAD (was kungfu-only); each block drains via UpdateMeleeBar; networked via **gmsgKFuPower**
  (CHAR 0..100); the client (ts_ammo) draws it as the bottom-box bar gated on melee. The bar colour FADES
  from the HUD colour (full) toward red (empty), not a threshold switch (TSHud_HealthBar). Top weapon-bar
  shows melee as count "x" only (not "x/max"). Tuning (user-playtested): re-block cadence +0.5s (RE fc_0_5,
  was 0.8), drain 33 (RE), continuous regen ~25/sec (never pauses, even while blocking).

Files: cl_dll/{ts_hud,ts_status,ts_powerup_hud,ts_weaponbar,ts_ammo,ts_attachments}.{cpp,h};
dlls/{ts_gun.{cpp,h},ts_knife.cpp,ts_weapon_info.cpp}. Builds clean (glibc 2.14). [[match-original-names-for-coverage]]

## 2026-06-26 (cont. 71) — lasersight map-change loss FIXED + per-weapon attachment binding FIXED (live-confirmed)

Two laser/attachment bugs the user reported, both RE-grounded + live-playtest-confirmed (UNCOMMITTED, on top of 514a50a).

1. **Lasersight/flashlight lost on MAP CHANGE** — the `ActItems` broadcast is change-detected on
   `CTSGun::m_iClientAttach`, whose cache SURVIVES a changelevel (the gun persists) so it never re-sends;
   the client was CLEARING `g_playerAttach` on `TS_Attachments_VidInit` → desync → laser/flashlight +
   dive-reticle distance gone after a map change. **Fix = the inverse of "force a re-send":** client.so
   is not reloaded across a map change, so the static `g_playerAttach` stays in sync with the surviving
   server cache as long as we DON'T clear it. Removed the `memset(g_playerAttach,…)` from
   `TS_Attachments_VidInit()` (kept the SPR-handle reset — those genuinely go stale). The original keeps
   its array likewise (a static global never cleared on level change), which is why it lacks this bug.
   (The prior `m_iClientAttach=-1`-in-Deploy attempt was the wrong fix — re-fired every deploy, broke
   fresh-buy; no server change is needed.) [[map-change-state-reset]]

2. **Attachment landed on the WRONG weapon** ("SOCOM+laser → the SHOTGUN gets the laser, and no SOCOM").
   Root cause: the buy menu `Apply()` (cl_dll/ts_buymenu.cpp) sent ALL weapons in one `tkw` then ALL
   attachments in a separate `tki` afterward. The server appends to `m_armament[]` in command order and
   `BuyArmament` applies via `CBasePlayer::AddItem` → the ACTIVE `CTSGun` (active = LAST weapon bought),
   so every attachment bound to the last weapon, and the per-weapon `Slot::attachMask` binding was lost.
   RE confirmed the original `BuyArmament@0x83f10`/`AddItemToArmament@0x83ea4`/`AddItem@0x8440c` apply the
   exact same active-weapon way — fidelity hinges on QUEUE ORDER. The original CLIENT (`FUN_10039400`)
   runs a sort-then-emit pass that sequences each accessory right after its weapon. **Fix:** `Apply()`
   now emits INTERLEAVED — each weapon's `tkw <id>_<n>` immediately followed by its own `tki <bit>` items
   (one tki per bit so `CTSGun::AddItem` validates each against that weapon's supported/built-in mask).
   Per-command emission also fixed the SOCOM going missing: the old single 256-char `tkw` string
   truncated/overflowed on a full loadout and dropped weapons. reference/BUY.md model unchanged (names/
   formats faithful); only the emission ORDER corrected. [[match-original-names-for-coverage]]

Verified by adding temporary `[TSATTACH]` server ALERTs (Deploy type/attach + broadcast idx/type/attach),
reading the trace from the live xash run, confirming the queue order + broadcast, then REMOVING the debug.
Builds clean (hl.so + client.so, glibc 2.14). HANDOFF open-work #1 (laser map-change) is DONE.

## 2026-06-26 (cont. 70 cont.2) — DIVE RETICLE reconstructed + numbers.spr font (UNCOMMITTED; laser-distance has a known map-change bug)

New client HUD **cl_dll/ts_reticle.{cpp,h}** (`CHudTSReticle`, wired in hud.h/hud.cpp + cl_dll/CMakeLists.txt).
The TS dive reticle: a center DONUT crosshair + a left "(" arc of 3 dive-step thirds colored by loadout
weight, with a dot tracking aim pitch. RE foothold (live trace on the original, see below):
- Sprites loaded by client.dll FUN_1004cb50 into a STATIC object @ client.dll+0xd0ca0 (handles read live:
  cross_e=0x3b/cross2=0x3c/cross_t=0x3d/divestept=0x3e/divestepc=0x3f/divestepb=0x40). Dims: divestep 40x80,
  cross 64x64. The DRAW funcs (FUN_1003254e @0x3254e, FUN_10033a6b @0x33a6b) decompile to GARBAGE (Ghidra
  lost the frames — reached via register/tail-call dispatch), so colors/positions were TUNED against the
  user's screenshots, not byte-RE'd. Full map: reference/STUNT.md? no — scratchpad/RETICLE_RE.md.
- Crosshair = **cross2** (donut, transparent bg) via SPR_DrawHoles tinted near-black (cross_e is the same
  art on a BLACK bg → only additive; cross_t is an X). NSEW ticks + are drawn as FillRGBA lines (2x4 / 4x2,
  the dot's base blue), pulled IN when a lasersight is equipped. NO center dot.
- 3 dive thirds (divestept/c/b) drawn OVERLAID at one position (each canvas holds its third) — blue if that
  dive tier is available, red if too heavy (CanDive High/Med/Low = free slots >39/29/19, from maxspeed via
  GetClientMaxspeed + the cont.69z slot formula). The aimed-at AVAILABLE third brightens; red never does.
- Pitch DOT rides a CIRCLE (R=33) around center: a 60-deg view cone (+-30 pitch, arc angle = pitch*3) maps
  to the arc's 180deg (30 up->top, level->left, 30 down->bottom). Dot is always the bright blue (104,169,240).
- Reticle hidden in spectate (g_iUser1 / IsSpectateOnly); ALSO suppressed the stock valve crosshair in
  spectate (hud_spectator.cpp SetCrosshair(m_hCrosshair) -> 0 in both OBS_IN_EYE/ROAMING branches).
- **numbers.spr sprite-font**: TSHud_DrawNumber (cl_dll/ts_hud.{cpp,h}) — digit imagemap rects from
  sprites/hud.txt (number_0..9, 11px each). Used for the lasersight DISTANCE readout (PM_TraceLine from the
  eye along v_angles, dist/52 = metres, drawn right of the reticle, gated on TS_LocalHasLaser).

🔴 OPEN / BROKEN:
- **Lasersight attach is lost on MAP CHANGE** (g_playerAttach reset client-side; server ActItems is
  change-detected on CTSGun::m_iClientAttach which survives the level → no re-broadcast). A `m_iClientAttach
  = -1` in Deploy() REGRESSED it (laser gone on fresh buy) → reverted. Needs a re-broadcast that doesn't
  break first-deploy. See [[map-change-state-reset]].
- **numbers.spr NOT yet wired into health / ammo-max / powerup (2/3/5)** — user asked; still text/other.
- Lasersight reticle should gate on the laser's ACTIVE toggle (useitem; starts on) not just equipped —
  deferred. Distance divisor /52 + the number position are tuned guesses.

## 2026-06-26 (cont. 70 cont.) — CTSStunt FULLY RE'd + reconstructed + live-playtest iterated (COMMITTED)

Committed the prior cont.70 checkpoint as **b8080fb** (gun attachments/powerups/slow-mo/damage sounds),
then did the user's goal: "faithfully reconstruct via RE the ENTIRE CTSStunt class and how it works".

LIVE-PLAYTEST ITERATIONS (each grounded in RE after the user flagged guessing) — committed together:
- **gravity/friction were SWAPPED + view_ofs mislabeled as punchangle.** Verified via progdefs.h + the
  offset map (gravity@0x11c, friction@0x120, view_ofs@0x174, punchangle@0x68 — confirmed against
  velocity@0x20/v_angle@0x74/button@0x180/flags@0x1a4). Swapped gravity<->friction + punchangle->view_ofs
  across all stunt methods. This fixed the "random gravity" (GoDive sets gravity=0.75 floaty arc on every
  dive; friction=0.25 on a low dive) AND revealed the PRONE VIEW source: Go* set pev->view_ofs=(0,0,0)
  (the g_vecZero->pev+0x174 I'd misread). The -8 in PM_CheckParamters is the DEATH cam (gated on dead).
- **Play dispatch must run AIRBORNE** (orig gates only ladder/water, not FL_ONGROUND) — my onGround gate
  killed the dive mid-air. **m_flLastStunt stamped every frame on ground** (PreThink @0x808cc): time since
  leaving ground < 0.7/timescale = the mid-air dive window (jump->dive + run->dive).
- **TSHandle damps the CMD, not velocity** (the __DT_REL slots = cmd.forwardmove/sidemove/upmove): SLIDE ->
  forwardmove=0 + side/up*0.3 (strafe-only + slow; your landing velocity carries you = the slide), STOP ->
  *0.5. I'd been zeroing velocity (killed the slide). **Landing slide-vs-roll** gated on JUMP/ALT1/DUCK
  (0x4006), not WASD -> you slide every dive landing.
- **PM_Jump returns while prone** (iuser4 & PRONE|SLIDE|DIVE|WHEEL|WALLJUMP_A|WALLCLIMB_A) -> jump never
  hops while prone, only triggers the getup. **CheckForWallClimb** gated on a JUMP-press edge + 0.3s window
  (NOT FL_ONGROUND — my bug broke wall-scaling); WALLCLIMB_A set -> hold-jump auto-climbs.
- **GETUP**: STANDUP bit 0x8 is NEVER set in the binary (TSStandUp dead). Reconstructed as a shared timed
  two-stage (m_flRollTime=0.75 from HandleSlide-end): intermediate eye 16 + getup anim (dive_<dir>_end) +
  STOP(slow)+free move, then at timer-end clear PRONE -> end eye = (DUCK held ? 12 duck : 28 stand), PM_Duck
  owns the hull from there. (Exact settled-prone getup trigger not 100% pinned; routed through this path.)
- **Animations**: wired CTSAnimation::Animate stunt codes to the model's real sequences (dive_<dir>_<grip>,
  dive_<dir>_end, slide_<dir> = the prone poses, crawl, wheel_*/lowwheel_*, walljump_climb/end, morfy_jump,
  bullettime). The slide_* set IS the lying-prone set (no separate prone idle).
- **Full RE map written: reference/STUNT.md.** New files: dlls/ts_stunt.{h,cpp}, reference/STUNT.md.

RE (complete map in **reference/STUNT.md**): decompiled all 25 CTSStunt methods (Init/Play/HandleStunt/
GoDive/GoRoll/GoWallClimb/GoWallJump/GoBulletTime/GoWheel/HandleDive/HandleSlide/HandleWheel/HandleWallJump/
HandleWallClimb/Landing/CanDive{High,Med,Low}/NextDive/SlotBonus/CheckForWall{Jump,Dive,Climb}/CheckForBreakables)
+ the pm_shared stunt family (TSHandle@0xe96a0 dispatcher, TSGoDuck, TSStandUp, TSDive, TSWallJump,
TSWallJumpClimb, PseudoClimb, CanJumpHigh) + PM_PlayerMove/PM_Duck. **THE KEY FINDING that unblocks it:**
the system is driven by ONE networked field **pev->iuser4** (entvars 0x250 -> pmove->iuser4 @0x208). The
engine round-trips iuser4 pev<->pmove (server) and networks it (clientdata->TxferLocalOverrides->entity_state
->prediction pmove, verified cl_dll/entity.cpp:87/210), so **pm_shared TSHandle() (compiled into BOTH hl.so +
client.so) PREDICTS the dive/prone small hull (usehull=1) + low view (VEC_DUCK_VIEW) + dive/wall launch
velocity on both sides** — exactly why the old DLL-only FL_DUCKING/UTIL_SetSize/view_ofs forcing never stuck
(the predictor recomputed the hull every frame). iuser4 bit map in reference/STUNT.md §1.

IMPL: new **dlls/ts_stunt.{h,cpp}** = real CTSStunt class (member CBasePlayer::m_TSStunt, Init in Spawn,
Play() from PreThink) writing pev->iuser4. New pm_shared hooks in **pm_shared/pm_shared.cpp** (TSHandle +
TSGoDuck/TSStandUp/TSDive/TSWallJump/TSWallJumpClimb; TSHandle() called from PM_PlayerMove before PM_Duck;
PM_Duck gated off while any stunt flag set). Removed the ad-hoc m_bDiveRolling/m_flWallClimbFuel/m_bProneSize
PreThink approximations from player.cpp (members left declared, now unused). Added TSPlayerFreeSlots() to
ts_gun.cpp (ts_weapons.h) for CanDive weight gating (lighter loadout = higher dives). ts_stunt.cpp in
dlls/CMakeLists.txt. **Builds clean (hl.so + client.so, glibc 2.14)**; CTSStunt + TSHandle linked both sides;
synced to the xash mod root. NOT committed — awaiting the user's live playtest (per workflow).

SLICES/notes: 3rd-person stunt POSES (CTSAnimation::Animate 0x28..0x39) still deferred — the TS specialist
player models aren't in this data extraction (Animate calls are made but no-op). gmsgTSNextStunt (stunt-meter
HUD byte) NOT sent (no client handler yet). PseudoClimb (ladder-style wall-grab refinement) stubbed/omitted.
Wall-jump up-speed (270) tuned (orig reads a .rodata const that read 0 at the computed offset). CheckForBreakables
(dive melee-shove) left to the existing TSCheckRunThrough. [[live-original-ts-debuggable]] [[match-original-names-for-coverage]]

## 2026-06-26 (cont. 70) — attachments + powerups + slow-mo/damage sounds + stunts (**UNCOMMITTED ON DISK**)

Very long interactive playtest session, NOT committed (21 modified + new `cl_dll/ts_attachments.{cpp,h}` on
top of `6ecf77b`; builds clean glibc 2.14). Full detail in HANDOFF.md "⭐⭐⭐ START HERE (cont.70)". Summary:
- **Gun attachments #11 + scope/laser/flashlight**: silencer (fire-sil + muzzle suppress; `fire.sc` iparam2=
  attach mask), scope (FOV cycle on secondary; AUG/Barrett built-in via weapon_info +0xe0/+0xe4 = new struct
  fields), lasersight+flashlight (NEW `ts_attachments.cpp` — original `ActItems` msg, TriAPI beam+dot/dlight).
- **Buy menu**: bit-index/value fix (display + mouse), green Buy/Akimbo, akimbo combine + both-icons + step-down.
- **Powerups**: super-jump (m_bLowGravity) + kung-fu (m_iKungFu) independent + bottom-center white HUD; kung-fu
  reload BLOCK (CCombatBlock window + VictimKungfuHold negate+stun). Double-fire → all weapons full-auto.
- **Slow-mo**: goslow.wav (EV_PlaySound, RE FUN_1004bef0) + 4 fading heartbeats; tint bluer.
- **Damage sounds**: bodyhit/headshot/kevlarhit (TraceAttack), pain1-4 (Pain), whizz1-5 flyby (closest-pt-on-seg).
- **Bugs fixed**: impact-ric "hear on approach" (was EMIT_AMBIENT_SOUND on world = static sound; → client
  entity-0 positional); map-change sprite-cache staleness (TSParticles_Reset + TS_Attachments_VidInit on VidInit).
- **🔴 INCOMPLETE — CTSStunt (roll/wall-climb/+alt1 dive/prone)**: ad-hoc PreThink approximations, NOT faithful.
  BLOCKER: dive/prone needs a client-PREDICTED small bbox+low view; DLL forcing (FL_DUCKING/UTIL_SetSize/
  view_ofs) is overwritten by pm_shared each frame → **needs pm_shared reconstruction gated by pev->iuser4
  stunt flags** (RE'd: HandleStunt@0x8b000, GoDive@0x8b1a0 sets iuser4 0x4/0x10+height bits, GoRoll@0x8cfe8,
  GoWallClimb@0x8aa1c). Decompiles in scratchpad/. The 3rd-person poses need the TS player models (not extracted).
- **🔴 PENDING (not started)**: glass double-pane penetration (RE the caliber gating + damage/decal-behind),
  golden-colts no-fire-sound-until-reload (prediction sync), wall-climb weight formula.

## 2026-06-26 (cont. 69z cont.) — weapon-feel + powerup + grenade + impact-effect pass (COMMITTED, live-playtested)

Long interactive playtest session; all RE-grounded. Committed to `main`. Items:

WEAPON SLOTS / MOVE SPEED (RE GetSpeedBySlots@0x66bd4, GetAccelBySlots@0x66c4c, slot cost = s_weapon_info+0xd0
byte): recovered all 38 per-weapon slot costs -> s_weapon_info.slotCost (knife 1, pistols 10, SMG/uzi 20,
rifle/shotgun 40, barrett/m60 70...). CBasePlayer base maxspeed = 210 + (120/81)*remaining (remaining = 81 -
sum of owned slotCost) -> TSSlotBaseSpeed (ts_gun.cpp), wired into player.cpp PreThink as the base that slow-mo
fuser1 scales. PICKUP GATE: AddWeapon -> bool, refuses a fresh weapon that won't fit 81 slots (GiveTSWeapon ->
NULL -> ts_groundweapon leaves it on the floor); already-owned weapons aren't re-picked-up except akimbo combines.
(Buy menu encumbrance was an explicit SLICE; slot cost is +0xd0, price is +0xd8 — distinct.)

DOUBLE-FIRERATE (RE PostThink@0x81610): the powerup is 1.5x NOT 2x (player+0x724&0x10 -> weapon-timer decrement
*= 1.5). Was an over-fast invented 2x (flRate*=0.5). Now flRate/=1.5 (predicted). Still makes semis fire-while-held.

HEALTH POWERUP DECAY (RE PreThink@0x808cc, player+0x73c = m_flHealthRegen): over-heal bleeds 1 HP/sec back to
max_health then disarms. Was set but never read; wired in player.cpp PreThink.

SLOW-MO SOUND PITCH: split TSSlowPitch (normal-recorded combat sounds, 100*perceivedSlow, capped 100) vs
TSRecordedSlowPitch (recorded-slow sounds — gun-fire + bullet-hit ric — 100+300*perceivedSlow, 1..255, sped up
at normal play, deepening in slow-mo). Applied to: thrown-knife impacts (ts_knife.cpp), per-shell shotgun racking
(weapons/insert-shell.wav, restored — the ShotgunReload rewrite had dropped it), and the bullet-impact ric.

SLOW BULLETS (ts_bulletmgr.cpp): per-caliber RE'd base speed (40*ammo_info[+0x24], kBulletSpeedUnit table) instead
of the flat 6000; faithful fuser1 slow factor (reverted a user-flagged "too slow" ramp deviation). Visual: a
short bullet_trail.spr dash that RIDES the bullet head (RE FUN_10035010, speed-scaled 5..25u) + shotgun_pellets.spr
head sprite (RE: original draws it via FUN_10050080) at native amber. Bullet-hit ric = debris/ricN, ATTN_STATIC.

GRENADE (RE CM61Grenade Spawn@0x7c974 / WaitThink@0x7cacc / BounceTouch@0x7ca90 + TSExplosion@0x6d01c): rewrote
CM61Grenade — swept WaitThink (trace 64u ahead, shatter anything with health <= 0.1*speed -> flies THROUGH glass
like the knife, not break-then-bounce), fuse counts in SLOWED time, detonates via TSExplosion. TSExplosion = a
FUNCTION (screen-shake + radius damage w/ linear falloff + ScreenFade flash on players); visual = TE_EXPLOSION
(SLICE: original's gmsgTSCreateDebris material-1 client fireball + slow-mo-point-on-spectacular-kill deferred).
Grenade ammo = have/don't-have (clip 1): throwing the last one drops the slot + GetBetterWeapon (like the knife).

BULLET IMPACT SHOWER + DECAL COMPAT (the big RE/compat fix): the ~50-dot "shower" was the ENGINE's
TE_GUNSHOTDECAL (our server DecalGunshot -> UTIL_GunshotDecalTrace sends 0x6d) = decal + R_BulletImpactParticles
burst + engine ric. VERIFIED in the binary: original ShootBulletsPlayer@0x5f69c lays NO server decal/TE at all;
the decal is CLIENT-side (client.dll DamageDecal FUN_10001000 picks {break/{shot/{bproof1/{splat by
pe->classnumber(+0x8c)==1 / pe->rendermode(+0x68)==0, then R_DecalShoot). So our server-side decal broke drop-in
compat (double vs original client, none vs original server). FIX: removed the server bullet decal (entry+exit) and
lay it CLIENT-side in EV_TSBulletImpact mimicking FUN_10001000 (breakable->{break, normal->{shot, else->{bproof1).
Decal-name gotcha (TS decals.wad): bare "{shot"/"{splat" don't exist (numbered only), bare "{break" is a DEBUG
"BREAK"-text lump — so use {shot1..5 and {break1..3, "{bproof1" bare. [[match-original-names-for-coverage]]
[[live-original-ts-debuggable]]

## 2026-06-25 (cont. 69z) — #14 right-click HOLD-POSITION toggle + #13 shotgun RELOAD state machine (live-playtested)

Both RE-grounded via typed Ghidra decompiles of the originals (re.sh) + viewmodel sequence dumps +
binary FP-constant reads. Built clean (hl.so + client.so, glibc 2.14) and synced to the xash mod root.
NOT yet committed — awaiting the user's live-playtest confirmation.

#14 HOLD-POSITION (RE CTSGun::SecondaryAttack@0x717a8): decompiled the whole secondary dispatch —
grenade/knife/katana/flag throw (fire-type 2/3/0xa/0xb) first, then akimbo modes 4/5 -> Fire(other gun),
then else: scoped (item+0x10 attach & 8) -> Zoom/FOV, else HOLD-POSITION TOGGLE gated on wi+0x28c != -1.
The toggle flips item+0x2c, plays the model's change/rechange transition (the +0xe field of the leaving
anim block), re-points the active anim block item+0x28 between wi+0x252 (normal) and wi+0x28c (hold), and
re-arms timers primary +0.3 / secondary +1.0 (verified doubles @0xf7fb8=0.3, @0xf6df8=1.0). KEY FINDING:
this is NOT just mk23/SOCOM — viewmodel dumps show paired stance sets (change/rechange + alt idle/shoot)
on mk23, desert, ak47, m4, m16, mp5k, uzi, mossberg, sawedoff. mk23 hold-idle = idlec(5) matches the
RE'd wi+0x28c=5. IMPL: s_weapon_info.iHoldChange/iHoldRechange/iHoldFireAnim (per-weapon seq indices from
each v_*.mdl), TSItem.holdPosition, CTSGun.m_bHoldPosition (synced to client predictor via weapon_data
iuser4, persisted per-item in Sync/LoadActiveFromItem). Toggle added to ItemPostFrame IN_ATTACK2 block
(non-akimbo + iHoldChange>=0); held-stance fire anim swapped in StandardFire (iHoldFireAnim). SLICE: scope
zoom branch + reload-in-hold-stance anim swap not wired (we don't have scope-attach plumbing yet).

#13 SHOTGUN RELOAD (RE ShotgunReload__6CTSGun@0x84aac + Reload@0x84d5c + StopReload@0x81288): Reload routes
fire-type 1 (PUMP: benelli/spas12/mossberg) straight to ShotgunReload, a 3-phase machine on item+8:
phase0 open (play seq, lock 0.3) -> phase1 insert 1 shell every 0.3s (wi+0x14=0.3, verified) until tube
full / reserve dry -> phase2 close/pump, end, secondary cooldown +3.0 (dc_3). The anim seqs are sent as
event fparam1 = 8/9/10 (phase codes the client remaps per-weapon, NOT raw indices — benelli reload1/2/3 are
at 2/3/4, mossberg at 8/9/10). reload1/2/3 are CONSECUTIVE in every pump v_*.mdl and our iReloadAnim already
= reload1 (open), so insert=+1, close=+2. THE BUG FIXED: old code replayed the OPEN seq every shell and never
played CLOSE -> gun stuck on the open pose ("held up, no shell, stays til fire"). New: CTSGun::ShotgunReload()
3-phase, driven each frame from ItemPostFrame while m_fInReload && pump; fire interrupt resets m_shotgunPhase
(StopReload); m_shotgunPhase reset on deploy (LoadActiveFromItem). Constants: dc_0_3=0.3, dc_3=3.0, wi+0x14=0.3
(disambiguated from a Write_mp5k spill via the +0x18 fire-rate store = mossberg 0.25). [[match-original-names-for-coverage]]

## 2026-06-25 (cont. 69y) — POWERUP / SLOW-MOTION / SLOW-BULLET subsystem + weapon fixes (commit 635c9ca)

Big session after the kung-fu kicks (below). All RE-grounded via 3 subagent RE passes (maps in scratchpad/):
POWERUP_RE.md, SLOWMO_PRESENTATION_RE.md, bulletmgr.c, ccombatattack.c. Committed `635c9ca` on `main`.

POWERUPS (RE POWERUP_RE.md): held timed powerups (slowmo 1 / slowpause 8 / dblfire 0x10) share ONE held slot
(player+0x728) + a double-tap-+use activation (client-side, CL_CreateMove 0.30s, cvar cl_usepowerup). Built:
cl_dll/ts_powerup_hud.{cpp,h} (green top-left "Slow Motion N" via PwUp msg = WriteShort(held)+WriteByte(dur)
from UpdateClientData; PwUpTime countdown); double-tap in cl_dll/input.cpp; UsePowerUp/UpdatePowerUpState in
ts_player.cpp; SlowMotionFlow (self 0.6/0.8 + LOS enemies 0.35/0.225 every 0.5s) + DeactivateSlowMotionFlow.
Pickup = TOUCH only (CTSPowerUp::WaitTouch, no FCAP_IMPULSE_USE — the IN_USE there is an optional swap). Mutual
exclusion is structural (single held slot overwritten on pickup).

SLOW-MOTION TIMING (RE SLOWMO_PRESENTATION_RE.md — the key doc): the slow factor lives in pev->fuser1 (CURRENT,
networked entvars float), eased toward m_flSlowMotionGo (TARGET, set by GoSlow) via InterpolateSlowMotion
(min(ft*7,1) step, 0.05 snap). fuser1 scales: maxspeed (movement), pev->framerate=max(fuser1,0.01) (animation),
AND the weapon-timer decrement (player.cpp PostThink + client prediction hl_weapons.cpp, both reading fuser1)
→ fire rate slows. ×1.5 if dblfire. SOUND PITCH: guns 100+300*slow (ev_ts.cpp; the wavs are "recorded-slow" so
~255 at normal → down in slow-mo), melee 100*slow (ts_gun.cpp TSMeleePitch; normal-recorded → slowed not sped).
SCREEN TINT: the original hijacks the engine SCREEN-FADE in V_CalcRefdef — RGBA(0,100,125) teal (NOT a green
fill — first RE pass wrongly said "no tint"), alpha (1-slow)*50, cvar cl_slowfade. TSSlowMo msg = WriteCoord(100*
PERCEIVED-world-slow) = the others-scale 0.35/0.225 (NOT the 0.6 self), drives the client smoothed g_flClientSlow.

SLOW-MO BULLETS (RE bulletmgr.c): dlls/ts_bulletmgr.cpp ≈ CBulletManager (256-slot ring). ShootBulletsPlayer
gate `rbullet = shooter slow < 0.99` → each pellet becomes a flying bullet instead of instant hitscan. Per
frame (CTSGameRules::Think): advance by GetBulletVelocityMult(slow,pauseFlag)*6000*frametime (slow-mo ≈ slow
= fast tracer; slow-pause = slow/((1-slow²)*10) ≈ dodgeable), trace (dont_ignore_glass → HITS glass), damage +
DecalGunshot on hit, else fly on; vanish when slow ends. Visual = a CBeam sprites/bullet_trail.spr extending
muzzle→bullet (from the model — TE_TRACER was invisible). SLICEs: no pierce re-seed; speed approximated 6000.

WEAPON FIXES: (1) AKIMBO — AkimboFire now fires BOTH guns in AUTO mode (uzi_akimbo iFireModes 0x21→AUTO; the
viewmodel both-fire seq from the .mdl dump: uzi akimbo_shoot1=12, beretta/gold linkedshoot=26/7) not alternate
(fixed "switches hands"). (2) mp5sd (silenced-base) + mossberg fire sounds restored (were nullptr / wrong path
weapons/mossberg/fire.wav, neither precached). (3) ammo powerup MultiplyClips → clip = wi->iClip*2 (DOUBLE MAX,
user-directed) split across akimbo barrels. USER-DIRECTED DEVIATION: slow-pause self-slow 0.8→0.6 (= slow-mo,
so fire/move don't speed up; only bullets slower).

WEAPON-SECONDARY RE (the agent's scratchpad/WEAPON_SECONDARY_RE.md write didn't persist — findings here):
SecondaryAttack@0x717a8 dispatches firetype (grenade/knife/katana throw) → mode 4/5 (fire other gun) → per-
weapon: scope(attach&8)→ZOOM, else HOLD-POSITION toggle if wi+0x28c!=-1 (mk23/SOCOM=5, flips m_pActiveItem+0x2c
+ SendWeaponAnim). Akimbo fireBoth = bothButtonsHeld || mode==0(AUTO); barrel side = item+0x24; both uses
firelinked.sc. Fire-modes 0-5 = AUTO/SEMI/BURST/PUMP/AKIMBO_ALT/AKIMBO_BOTH at item+0x02, default from the
wi+0xc mask. SILENCER: client FUN_1003de90 picks <weapon>/fire-sil.wav when (iparam2&1); silencer = bit0 of the
attach mask (item+0x10 live / +0x124 stored); server docks dmg ×0.775. **Our fire event mis-packs barrel-side
in iparam2 — the original uses iparam2=attach-mask, bparam1=barrel side (align this when wiring #11/#15).**

OPEN (task tool #10-15 + sawed-off): #10 dblfire timeout (code looks right — need symptom/live test); #11
bought-silencer -sil sounds + event attach-mask align; #12 thrown knife/katana flying-speed slow; #13 shotgun
reload pose; #14 SOCOM hold-toggle (RE'd, not impl); #15 akimbo L/R-per-button (mode 4/5); sawed-off + maybe
other shotgun wavs are normal-recorded → need the 100*slow formula not 100+300*slow (ask user which weapons).

## 2026-06-25 (cont. 69y) — kung-fu KICKS dispatch RE-faithful (CCombatAttack__6CTSGun @0x86078)

User picked the kung-fu KICKS dispatch from the carried weapon-feel TODOs. Rewrote `CTSGun::CloseCombatAttack`
(dlls/ts_gun.cpp) as a faithful port of the decompiled CCombatAttack__6CTSGun (scratchpad/ccombatattack.c),
replacing the old approximation. Static-RE'd, not guessed — decoded the raw decompile by computing the
entvars_t offsets from progdefs.h and pulling every DAT_ constant from the binary.

DECODE (entvars offsets): pev+0x180 = button (IN_ATTACK 1 / IN_DUCK 4 / IN_BACK 0x10 / IN_ATTACK2 0x800);
pev+0x1a5 = byte 1 of flags → &2 = FL_ONGROUND(0x200), &0x40 = FL_DUCKING(0x4000); pev+0x174 = view_ofs
(eye-height tweak on dive kicks); pev+0x250 = iuser4 (TS lock mask 0x50c30); player+0x79c = whiff-lunge
timer. Damage = local_114 (punches 0x23=35, kicks 0x2d=45, back-kick 0x37=55). Combo counters: punch
this+0x9fc (m_comboStep), kick this+0xa00 (m_kickCombo), last-anim this+0xa04 (m_lastMeleeAnim).

⚠️ REFIRE = local_108 (CORRECTED mid-session — see below): kung-fu is FULL-AUTO (standard ItemPostFrame holds
fire → repeats at the cap). I first read the refire as local_10c (0.1s normal punch) from the decompile's
frame arith, BUT that was WRONG — Ghidra's stack analysis was corrupted by a function-boundary overlap
(CCombatAttack tail mis-symbolizes as SlowMotionFlow; hand-disasm desyncs on the reordered blocks). The USER
live-confirmed the original punch cadence: full-auto capped at ~4/sec, identical hold-vs-click. 4/sec = 0.25s
= local_108 = DAT_00107e98 (the normal-punch constant) EXACTLY. So refire = local_108; local_10c (0.1-0.35) is
the VICTIM block-stun (BlockPlayer(player, local_10c*0.75)). [[live-original-ts-debuggable]],
[[flag-overriding-and-dead-code]].

KICK dispatch (IN_ATTACK2), first-match: duckkick (onGround && (IN_DUCK||FL_DUCKING), 45dmg, 1.0s) →
back-kick (movingBack: +back key when speed≤100, else v_forward·vel_unit ≤ −0.5; 55dmg, onGround?1.0:1.35s) →
sidekick-dive (airborne && speed>270 && IN_DUCK && fwdDot>0.5; 45dmg, 1.0s, resets kick combo) → ground kick
combo (onGround || speed≤200): 3 basic kicks (alt 0xb/0xc, 45dmg, 0.3s, m_kickCombo++) then a SPIN FINISHER
when m_kickCombo>2 (no-repeat cycle 0xa/0xe/0xd/0xf, 45dmg, 0.5s, reset) → else flying/jump kick (cycle
0x13/0x12/0xf, 45dmg, 0.75s, reset). PUNCH dispatch (IN_ATTACK), all 35dmg: airborne→air-punch (0.5s);
onGround && (m_comboStep>2 || duck-TAP[IN_DUCK && !FL_DUCKING])→uppercut (0.65s, reset); else normal jab
(0.25s, m_comboStep++, shown as 3 cycling v_melee jabs). Counters are PERSISTENT — reset only on a finisher/
dive, no time-window (removed the old 0.5s chaining reset). USER-CONFIRMED feel ("this looks good"): visible
3-jab→uppercut, full-auto 4/sec.

ANIM REMAP: the original kung-fu viewmodel has ~26 seqs (ids 0xa..0x19); our v_melee.mdl has 11, so each id
maps to the nearest seq + the 3rd-person player kung-fu seq. Dispatch/damage/timing are byte-faithful; the
anim is a remap (consistent with the cont.69q 11-seq decision).

SLICEs (documented in-code, not yet ported): the forward whiff-LUNGE (local_110 → player+0x79c, a decaying
PreThink velocity push applied on a MISS, scaled by GetMeleeMultiplier + doubled by the KungFu powerup) is a
separate PreThink subsystem (prethink.c lines 70/181) — kept as per-move magnitude comments; iuser4 lock-state
(0x50c30 → forced light attack) and player+0x814/0x815 bits (special-punch 0x17 / forced finisher) default to
"clear" (the common path). The melee screen-shake is unchanged (live-measured punch 20 / kick 25 → ×0.35).

Also recovered the canonical attack-id → 3rd-person body-anim names from HandleCloseCombat__12CTSAnimation
(0xa circfront / 0xb circkick / 0xc circkicklow / 0xd circback / 0xe latback / 0xf circspin / 0x10 sidekick /
0x11 backkick / 0x12 airkick / 0x13 airkick2 / 0x14 duckkick / 0x16 punchleft / 0x17 punchright) — so 0x10 is
SIDEKICK and 0x14 is DUCKKICK (my branch comments said dropkick/handstand; IDs/anims are what matter).

VERIFIED: hl.so + client.so build clean (glibc 2.14); deployed to the xash rig; runs no-crash; USER playtested
and confirmed "this looks good" (the full-auto 4/sec cadence + visible 3-jab→uppercut). See
[[live-original-ts-debuggable]], [[match-original-names-for-coverage]]. Ready to commit.

NEXT: remaining weapon-feel TODOs (dynamic-spread edge cases, weapon sway, coldcock whip, breakable respawn,
katana throw).

## 2026-06-25 (cont. 69x) — TS client PARTICLE / impact-effect subsystem DONE + LIVE-VERIFIED

The cont.69w next-task is COMPLETE. Byte-ported the original's custom client particle pool (NOT engine
tempents, NOT R_SparkShower) into **cl_dll/ts_particles.{h,cpp}**; hooked `TSParticles_Update()` into
`HUD_DrawTransparentTriangles` (cl_dll/tri.cpp); routed cl_dll/ev_ts.cpp `EV_TSBulletImpact`→`TS_ImpactEffect`
(per-surface dispatcher) and `EV_TSMelee`→`TS_MeleeImpact` (glint+sparks only). Full RE map persists in
scratchpad/impact-effects-re.md (on-disk, gitignored). Builds clean (glibc 2.14); runs in xash.

CRUX LOCATED (the handoff's stated blocker): the per-frame update/render = **FUN_100520d0(pool)**, found via
xrefs to the pool object DAT_1018bde8 from HUD_DrawTransparentTriangles. Reconstructed: manager
(FUN_1004ffe0/100509d0/100509a0/10050b60), billboard (FUN_10050ce0/10050080), 5 spawners (smoke 46680 /
debris 46bd0 / scintille 46f50 / spark-shower 492b0 / pellets 46a70), dispatcher FUN_10048f60 (per-surface
texture-char switch + 33/50/70 RandomLong gating).

VERIFIED BY LIVE GDB TRACE of the running original hl.exe (client.dll), NOT guessed — this caught what the
static decompile got wrong:
- pos += vel * frametime * _DAT_10079e88(**10**) — the missing ×10 velocity scale (sparks were too slow);
  gravity = gravity*0.1*sv_gravity(800) = ×80 in velocity-space (×10 in pos → real 800 u/s²).
- SMOKE = a CONIC FLARE: 4 puffs marching out pos=origin+normal*size*0.8*i (size ×0.8/step), each stretched
  (stretch 7) + growing (accel 0.1). The velocity divisor **DECREMENTS /(count-i)** (live vel.x = 3.5,4.4,
  13.0,9.9 across the 4 puffs) so the tip puffs eject faster — this is the "ejects further/faster" the user
  saw; I'd misread param_11 as a constant. frameRate = 20±10 jitter (live range 10-30). Every spawn arg +
  motion field (gravity/drag/bright/fade/accel/size/stretch/frameRate) byte-matched the live scratch particle.
- Spawner params RE-audited from raw ASM of FUN_10048f60 (the FP10-garbled decompile mis-mapped some): debris
  count = RandomLong(5/2,5) = 2-5 (the 0x20=32 is the velocity SPREAD, not count — I'd swapped them).

BUG FIXES found along the way: sprite-table name buffer 24→64 (truncated name broke the cache → 64-entry
table filled in seconds → all effects died PERMANENTLY); pool free-slot allocator OOB cursor walk; melee
event made SERVER-AUTHORITATIVE (flags 0, #ifndef CLIENT_DLL — the client-predicted melee world-trace misses,
so FEV_NOTHOST gave the local slasher no spark); glass penetration per-pierce **damage_adjust = damagemult
cvar value** (default 0, RE-matched — `*(damagemult+0xc)`), NOT 0.75 → two panes break only the first +
DECAL the second; the "black dots" were the stock Valve {shot decals from my added server DecalGunshot —
restored as server-side (entry+exit) so all clients see them, resolving the TS {shot from ts/decals.wad
(user: "bullet decals match TS exactly"). Debris chips now TUMBLE (orient-1 roll).

KNOWN APPROXIMATIONS (faithful behaviour, not byte-exact rendering): velocity-stretch billboard geometry
(FUN_10050080) reconstructed not byte-ported; debris roll done screen-space (orig uses hw.dll DAT_100d5b88);
concrete debris uses kRenderTransAlpha(4) not RE's TransColor(1) (our TriAPI draws INDEXALPHA TransColor as
an unmasked square). See [[sparta-overrides-write-weapon]], [[live-original-ts-debuggable]],
[[flag-unfound-re-early]].

NEXT: the carried-over weapon-feel TODOs (kung-fu KICKS dispatch, dynamic-spread edge cases, weapon sway,
coldcock whip, breakable respawn, katana throw) — see HANDOFF.md. Same live-trace-don't-guess method.

## 2026-06-24 (cont. 69w) — IMPACT-vs-surface effects: penetration+glass DONE; particle byte-port STARTED (THE next task)

User asked to validate/fix bullet·knife·thrown-knife·katana·thrown-katana·kungfu·grenade impact-vs-surface
logic + effects. Full RE + build plan in **scratchpad/impact-effects-re.md**.

DONE + DEPLOYED:
- BULLET PENETRATION rewritten to match the original CBasePlayer::ShootBulletsPlayer (@nm 0x5f69c; BULLETS.md
  had the wrong addr 0x6f69c=Ghidra). Uniform PointContents loop: penDepth=min(dmg*2,48); pass-through iff
  UTIL_PointContents(endpos+dir*penDepth)!=CONTENTS_SOLID. So pass-through depends on weapon damage + the
  enter→exit slice thickness (angle) — matches the user's spec. Removed our special glass branch.
  (dlls/ts_gun.cpp TSFireBulletsPenetrate.) damage_adjust per-pierce = 0.75 (VERIFY: orig reads damagemult[+0xc],
  relocated — pin live).
- GLASS no longer always breaks: PointContents tests WORLD brushes only, so glass (func_breakable ENTITY)
  always reads non-solid → bullets pass through; the pane SHATTERS only via ApplyMultiDamage iff dmg >= its
  health = **20** in TS maps (one 40). So most guns (>=20 dmg) one-shot it (correct), weak ones (skorpion 16,
  pdw 16, usas 7) don't.

THE NEXT TASK — BYTE-PORT the TS client PARTICLE subsystem (user: visual fidelity; it's CLIENT-LOCAL, does
NOT affect drop-in compat — that's protocol, already faithful). Impact effects feed a custom particle pool
(DAT_1018bde8), NOT engine tempents; our current EV_TSBulletImpact/EV_TSMelee use R_SparkShower = wrong (orig
sparks via sprites/scintille_metal.spr). Mapped: 300-byte particle struct (scratch DAT_1018a720), pool +
manager fns (FUN_1004ffe0/100509d0/100509a0/10050b60), spawner pattern, the dispatcher FUN_10048f60
(per-surface texture-char switch + RandomLong gating) + wrapper FUN_10044bf0 (5 call sites). STILL TO FIND:
the per-frame UPDATE+RENDER fn (the look). 6-step build plan + per-surface effect table + struct layout all
in scratchpad/impact-effects-re.md. Glass also wants a CRACK ("windshield") decal on non-breaking hits
(CBreakable::DamageDecal). NOT built — all builds clean+deployed so far; resume at the particle struct/manager.

## 2026-06-24 (cont. 69w) — ⭐ ANGLE-RECOIL fully RE'd + reconstructed (client-side aim kick)

Corrected the cont.69v trail (it pointed at vgui panel 0x648c0 / vtable[0x38] = a dead end; that slot
is just vgui::Panel::getAbsExtents on a plain Panel). Found the REAL system via live trace + static RE:

LIVE MODEL (unbuffered os.pread poll of cl.viewangles pitch @0x2d8aec4, user fired no-mouse): each shot
eases the pitch UP and STAYS (2s between shots = zero recovery → PERSISTENT aim move, NOT punchangle).
Per-frame deltas decay ×0.85, first frame ≈ 0.15× kick. Total ≈6.4° for the tested weapon.

SOURCE (client.dll, static RE confirmed): the "0.85/0.15" is frametime-dependent — real constant = 15.0.
- ON FIRE — FUN_10008230 @0x8230 (client twin of server VKickback@0x70414, SAME tuning): vert=amount*0.85;
  horiz=vert*firetypeScale (ft1=-0.25, ft4/5=+0.15, ft6/7=-0.30, ft8=+0.35, ft9=-0.35, else 0); *0.775
  duck; *0.66667 bullet-time. accum.pitch(DAT_10191d10)-=vert; accum.yaw(DAT_10191d14)+=horiz. amount =
  flViewKick(weapon 0x30)*modifier (call-site mods 0.35/1.0/2.0 — NOT yet pinned to weapons), firetype=0x348.
- EACH FRAME in V_CalcRefdef — FUN_10057ed0 @0x57ed0: remaining=target-applied; if |rem|²>=0.01:
  rate=min(frametime*15,1); delta=rem*rate; applied+=delta; viewangles+=delta (PERSISTENT). else snap to 0.
Full decompiles + constants (with file offsets) in scratchpad/recoil-live-findings.md.

RECONSTRUCTED (built clean, deployed to xash rig; awaiting playtest):
- NEW cl_dll/ts_recoil.h + TS_AddViewRecoil()/TS_UpdateViewRecoil() in cl_dll/view.cpp (g_recoilTarget/
  g_recoilApplied; ease at frametime*15, snap <0.1°; commits to the aim via Get/SetViewAngles each frame
  during the kick + bumps pparams->cl_viewangles for the current frame).
- TS_UpdateViewRecoil(pparams) called early in V_CalcNormalRefdef (before cl_viewangles→viewangles copy).
- EV_TSFire (cl_dll/ev_ts.cpp) local-player block now calls TS_AddViewRecoil(wi->flViewKick, wi->iFireType,
  args->ducking, false) — replaced the old V_PunchAxis(0,-2.0) placeholder. bullet-time arg = false (VERIFY:
  no client slow-mo flag wired). amount = flViewKick directly (modifier=1.0 assumed; CALIBRATE vs original).
NEXT: playtest vs the running original per weapon; if magnitude off, pin the FUN_10008230 call-site
modifier ([item+2]==1?1.0:0.35 @0x90be; bl?2.0:1.0 @0x9cea). Measure the YAW component live too.

UPDATE (same session) — playtest showed ours UNDER-DRIFTS vs original (skorpion full-auto). Root cause
found + fixed: the original recoil has a SECOND part — a per-shot damped SCREEN SHAKE (FUN_10057fa0 setup
@0x57fa0 + FUN_10058000 apply @0x58000, called from V_CalcRefdef) whose amplitude RAMPS WITH FIRE RATE
(amp=(0.15-dt)*15, cap 1, *0.775 duck; <=0.001 -> none). So single/slow shots = clean climb, full-auto =
climb + growing scatter (the "pronounced drift"). I'd only built the climb. Verified flViewKick[skorpion]
=0.25 is CORRECT from the binary (Write_skorpion @0x8d3f0), so the climb (0.21°/shot) is faithful — the
shake was the gap. Added the shake to cl_dll/view.cpp — but REVERTED it: the user clarified GUNS DON'T SHAKE, they just move
the aim (the climb); the screen-shake/"bounce-back" is the MELEE/KNIFE feel ("the knife doesn't recoil but
it does bounce back"). My ±1° shake on guns drowned the small climb -> the skorpion felt like "no functional
recoil." So view.cpp is now CLIMB-ONLY for guns (the working state for other weapons); the shake helpers were
removed (reconstruct FUN_10057fa0/58000 on the knife/melee path later if the bounce is wanted — full algo is
in scratchpad/recoil-live-findings.md). Debug Con_Printf removed. Built+deployed.

Skorpion specifics (RE-confirmed, no bug): single skorpion (firetype 9) routes FUN_100091e0 -> amount =
flViewKick directly (=0.25, verified Write_skorpion @0x8d3f0) -> climb 0.21°/shot — genuinely low, faithful.
Akimbo skorpion (firetype 4) routes FUN_100096f0 -> amount = 2.0*flViewKick + fires both barrels -> ~4x the
kick; user says the AKIMBO "looks more correct". So the single's weak climb matches the binary. OPEN: confirm
vs original single skorpion; if original single kicks harder, recheck the FUN_100091e0 amount path / weapon
0x38 gate. NEXT (separate): the KNIFE bounce-back = the shake on the melee path.

⭐ ROOT CAUSE of the weak/wrong recoil (cont.69w) — the Write_<weapon> values are an EARLIER init stage that
gets OVERWRITTEN on BOTH server and client by ONE authoritative combat table (NOT a server/client split):
- server: compile_weapons_info -> Sparta() @0x6fa78 -> SetSpartaWeapon(idx, spread, viewKick, recoil, dmg)
  @0x6fa34, sets s_weapon_info +0x28/+0x30/+0x34/+0x1c.
- client: FUN_10007a80 -> FUN_10007a50 — BYTE-IDENTICAL calls (same indices, same hex values).
So there's one real value per weapon. We had used the Write_ stage (the prev agent's "table verified from
Write_<weapon>" read the wrong stage). Found by tracing the single-skorpion recoil amount (live break = 0.5,
not the static 0.25; Sparta sets skorpion +0x30 = 0x3f000000 = 0.5). ~22 of 32 guns differ: skorpion 0.25→0.5,
beretta 3→2.5, uzi 1.5→1.75, benelli 10→13, m4 4→3.75, mp5k 3→2.25, desert 8→7.5, ak47 5→5.5, mossberg 14→8.5,
m16 4.5→4, ruger 0.3→0.35, bull 18→13, glock22 4.5→5, mac10 4→3, gold 5→5.5, contender/36 12→7.5, …
FIX: replaced kViewKick[] in dlls/ts_weapon_info.cpp with the Sparta/SetSpartaWeapon values (all 32 decoded;
the 6 melee/grenade indices Sparta doesn't list keep Write values). Built hl.so+client.so, deployed.
MELEE "bounce-back" shake ADDED (cont.69w) — RE-confirmed it's melee-only, NOT guns. Live-traced Shake_Setup
(client FUN_10057fa0 @0xc0c7fa0): swinging the knife fired it from FUN_1000a270 @0xa345 (the client melee
attack) with amp=4.5/dur=0.2/freq=10; firing GUNS did NOT fire it (the gun-recoil shake branch in FUN_10008230
@0x83b2 never tripped — confirms guns climb-only). Formula: amp = meleeWeapon flDamage * 0.15 (*0.66667 in
bullet-time) — knife dmg 30 -> 4.5 (matches). Shake = damped oscillation (random ±amp offset, sign-flip+halve
each 1/freq cycle, smoothed), TRANSIENT (settles to 0 = "shake + reset to where it was"), applied to the
RENDER view only (never the aim). Impl: cl_dll/view.cpp g_meleeShake + TS_TriggerMeleeShake(dmg,bt) +
TS_ApplyMeleeShake(pparams) (called after punchangle in V_CalcNormalRefdef, adds to pparams->viewangles);
triggered per swing in CTSGun::MeleeAttack (dlls/ts_gun.cpp, #ifdef CLIENT_DLL -> client-predicted = local
player; fire-rate gate = once per swing). Built hl.so+client.so (symbols: client.so has Trigger/ApplyMeleeShake,
hl.so has none — gating correct), deployed.

KUNG-FU shake ALSO added (cont.69w) — user reported knife bounced but kung-fu didn't (it's CCombatAttack,
not MeleeAttack). Live-traced: kung-fu punch/kick fire Shake_Setup from a DIFFERENT site (client FUN_1000af10
@0xb5e5) with amp = min(|velocity|*0.15385 [1/6.5, 0x1007a8f8], 45 [cap 0x1007a900]) * 0.35 [0x1007a8a8],
dur 0.2/freq 10. So it's VELOCITY-scaled (punch~7.0/kick~8.75 in the trace = the player's move speed), a
DIFFERENT multiplier (0.35) than the knife's fixed dmg*0.15. Generalized the trigger: TS_TriggerViewShake(amp)
(caller computes amp); knife passes flDamage*0.15, kung-fu passes the velocity formula. Wired in
CTSGun::CloseCombatAttack (#ifdef CLIENT_DLL, after SendWeaponAnim). CORRECTION (same session): user reported kung-fu only shook while MOVING — wrong, it must ALWAYS shake on
attack. The decompile's SQRT(velocity) is the attack's LUNGE velocity (the kung-fu move imparts a forward
lunge, non-zero even standing still), NOT the player's pre-attack movement — I'd wired m_pPlayer->pev->velocity
which is 0 when stationary. Our reconstruction doesn't model the lunge yet, so we approximate `power` with the
move's `dmg` (always > 0 -> always shakes): amp = min(dmg, 45) * 0.35. Built+deployed. AWAITING playtest:
knife/katana bounce (fixed dmg*0.15), kung-fu bounce ALWAYS on punch/kick, guns climb-only.

MAGNITUDE FIX (same session): user confirmed kung-fu bounce was too big (our dmg 35-55 vs original power ~20-25).
The shake `power` = the move's LUNGE velocity*0.15385 (we don't model the lunge), measured live as punch~20 /
kick~25 -> amp 7.0 / 8.75. Switched to per-category fixed power: kfPower = fSecondary ? 25 : 20; amp =
kfPower*0.35 (CloseCombatAttack, ts_gun.cpp). Built+deployed. VERIFY: special kicks (side/back/spin) + uppercut
not separately measured (assumed punch=20/kick=25 by the primary/secondary split).

FULL COMBAT TABLE re-sourced from Sparta (cont.69w, DONE) — Sparta also overrides spread(0x28)/recoil(0x34)/
DAMAGE(0x1c), so the Write_<weapon> values were the wrong stage for those too. Reconstructed the original's
structure in dlls/ts_weapon_info.cpp: added a SetSparta(idx, spread, viewKick, recoil, dmg) helper (mirrors
SetSpartaWeapon @0x6fa34) + 32 SetSparta(...) calls in the original Sparta() order, run after the Write_<weapon>
calls — overwriting flSpread/flViewKick/flRecoil/flDamage for the 32 firearms (6 melee/grenade/flag keep Write
values). Replaced the kViewKick array (now folded into Sparta); kept kUsesSpread. Decoded values from
ts_i386.so Sparta @0x6fa78 (full table in scratchpad/recoil-live-findings.md). Damage examples now corrected:
barrett 210->185, m4 34->33, beretta 29->27, desert 55->49, mk23 36->33. Built hl.so+client.so, deployed.

FULL WRITE_ + SPARTA AUDIT (cont.69w, both byte-exact). Extracted every Write_<weapon> field from ts_i386.so
(disasm of the 38 Write_ fns -> /tmp/write_fields) and diffed vs our table. All 32 guns' Write_ fields already
matched; fixed the melee/grenade outliers: m61 (clip 25->1, rate 0.092->1.0, spread 0.028->0.1, dmg/recoil->0,
pellets 1->2), knife pellets 1->5, sealknife 1->10, katana 1->0, flag firemodes 2->0. Added kWriteViewKick (the
Write_-stage view-kick, all 38) applied before SetSparta so the WRITE stage is byte-exact too (Sparta then
overrides the 32 guns; the 6 melee keep their Write_ vk, mostly unused). Verifier (parses our Write()+arrays+
kWriteViewKick+SetSparta vs binary Write_ AND Sparta): 0 Write mismatches, 0 Sparta mismatches, 32 SetSparta
calls. ONLY gap: flag (idx 29) is in the binary Write_flag but intentionally blank in our table (CTF objective,
not a fired weapon) — add Write_flag if full coverage of the non-combat flag entry is ever wanted.
AWAITING playtest. Recoil model = climb-only for guns (ease frametime*15, persistent); shake = melee/knife
(fixed dmg*0.15) + kung-fu (per-category power*0.35), transient render-only.

## 2026-06-24 (cont. 69v) — ⭐ LIVE TRACE located the angle-recoil (client view-prediction, NOT punchangle)

Static RE dead-ended on the aim recoil (no server v_angle write; CL_CreateMove + all 3 SetViewAngles
callers are standard mouse/keyboard). Resolved with a LIVE gdb WATCHPOINT on the running original (user
fired one shot, NO mouse): pitch kicked 1.61→1.12 (~0.49° UP) = the recoil moves cl.viewangles (the real
aim), confirming the user's "punchangle isn't a thing; recoil is angle-based."

ENTRY POINT (client.dll, live base this run = 0xc070000; PE imagebase 0x10000000 so live = base + RVA):
- cl.viewangles live @ 0x2d8aec4 (pitch)/0xc8/0xcc — found by reading engine GetViewAngles (ptr at
  gEngfuncs+0x88; gEngfuncs = Initialize's DAT_100d5b28 = RVA 0xd5b28) and decoding its mov-from-abs.
- The recoil write chain (bt): engine 0x1db74e0 (= gEngfuncs slot DAT_100d5c60) ← client FUN_1005b3c0
  (thunk, RVA 0x5b3c0, wraps that engine fn) ← client method @RVA 0x648c0.
- @0x648c0 is a per-frame client view-compute: it calls a VIRTUAL `this->vtable[0x38]`(&pitch,&yaw,&roll)
  to get the recoiled angles, then FUN_1005b3c0(&angles) commits them via the engine. **THE RECOIL MATH
  IS IN vtable[0x38]** of that client object (param_1; big object, fields 0x83/0x85-0x8a/0x2a9/0x2aa).
NEXT: decompile vtable[0x38] to extract the per-shot pitch/yaw recoil formula (scaled by weapon — small,
bigger on knives), then reconstruct it client-side. To find the vtable[0x38] target: read param_1's vtable
(*param_1) in the live process, slot 14 (0x38/4); param_1 is likely a client singleton.

WATCHPOINT RECIPE (reusable): gdb -p <pid> -batch with `watch *(float*)<cl.viewangles_pitch_addr>` (a
value-watch only fires on CHANGE — with no mouse, only the recoil changes it), `commands{ bt; detach; quit}`,
`continue`. Resolve bt return addrs to module+RVA: addr − module_base = RVA → rz-bin -E name. Module bases
via reloc-free prologue scan of /proc/<pid>/mem (CBreakable::Die for mp.dll, V_CalcRefdef for client.dll).

## 2026-06-24 (cont. 69v) — recoil view-punch (VKickback) + dynamic accuracy/spread WIRED + kungfu smoke

VKickback @0x70414 (recoil view-punch → pev->punchangle): vert = 0.85*flViewKick(0x30), horiz per firetype
(pistol +0.35, akimbo +0.15, pump -0.25, autoshotgun/sniper -0.30, auto-smg -0.35), *0.775 ducked, *0.667
bullet-time. Gated on weaponinfo+0x38 (all guns=1, melee/grenade=0). Called from StandardFire. NOTE the
original gates the SERVER apply on FL_FAKECLIENT (real players predict client-side) — we apply directly so
it shows on the listenserver. User clarified: punchangle is VISUAL ONLY (recovers, and bullets use v_angle
not punchangle) — the AIM-MOVE recoil is a SEPARATE client-side mechanism (viewangle kick on fire) NOT yet
located; sweep of the server (FireBulletsPlayer/DropKickback/PreThink) found NO v_angle write → it's in the
client CreateMove/input. TODO: RE the client-side aim recoil.

Dynamic accuracy/spread NOW WIRED (RE ScaleSpread @0x802a8 + the decay finally found in PreThink @0x808cc):
effective bullet spread = weapon flSpread(0x28) + per-player accumulator (CBasePlayer::m_flSpreadAccum =
player+0x778); ScaleSpread grows it per shot: accum = (1-recovery)*flRecoil(0x34)*factor + accum, capped 0.1,
factor=2.0 (*0.5 bullet-time, *0.775 duck), recovery = m_flSlowMotionGo*dt_since_last_shot (cap 0.5), duck
also tightens base *0.875; gated on bUsesSpread(0x2c). PreThink decays: accum -= m_flSlowMotionGo*frametime*0.1.
So spraying widens the cone, it recovers when you stop. SKIPPED edge cases: field_0xc8==0x20 (m60 5x recoil),
==0x12 (barrett max-spread-when-moving). Added m_flSpreadAccum (player.h) + m_flLastShotTime (ts_gun.h).

Kung-fu wall-hit smoke: added a server TE_SPRITE gun_smoke_add puff (smoke only, no decal/spark) in
CloseCombatAttack's surface branch — APPROXIMATION; user wants the original spawn (likely the client impact
dispatcher, same as bullets). TODO: RE the kung-fu client-event smoke spawn.

## 2026-06-24 (cont. 69v) — viewbob: removed eye-bob + RE'd the TS weapon-sway (figure-8 pendulum)

User: the stock HL bob dropped the EYES "like half-ducking" while running + snapped between 2 frames.
Root cause: stock `cl_dll/view.cpp` adds V_CalcBob to the MAIN view origin and the bob saturates its
-7..+4 clamp at TS speeds (square wave). RE of the ORIGINAL client.dll V_CalcRefdef (FUN_10067890):
the bob is applied to the VIEWMODEL ONLY (eyes get only a SMOOTHED view-height lerp), and the gun "bob"
is actually a custom **weapon-sway** (FUN_10066e70), not stock bob.

Fixes: (1) removed `pparams->vieworg[2] += bob` (eyes no longer bob — faithful). (2) replaced the stock
viewmodel vertical bob with the TS figure-8 sway. **Constants read LIVE from the running original**
(client.dll base via V_CalcRefdef reloc-free prologue; the FP consts are mostly DOUBLES): velmult=0.00333

SIMPLIFIED (not yet faithful): the amplitude SMOOTHING (state DAT_10191d6c/d78), per-weapon GRIP scaling,
and the forward base-position term (forward·(0.75−amp·0.5)) — the full FUN_100674a0 viewmodel-positioning.
Next: port the amplitude-smoothing + grip + forward term for byte-faithful sway.

## 2026-06-24 (cont. 69v) — knife slash + kung-fu combo + FULL weapon-table re-verification

**Melee anims/combos** (RE CCombatAttack @0x86078, KnifeFire @0x84044, verified vs model seq dumps):
- Knife `MeleeAttack`: removed the press-only gate → continuous slashing while held (gated by flFireRate like
  kung-fu); cycles 3 verified v_*.mdl slash seqs (knife {3 slash1,4 left,5 right}; katana/sealknife {2,3,4}).
- Kung-fu FIRE combo: replaced our mod-3+duck-uppercut with the real `field_0x9fc` counter — 3 jabs
  (punch_left 2/punch_right 3/punch_right2 10) then UPPERCUT (7), looping; +back forces it early.
- Lesson: the model sequence tables (v_melee 11 seqs, v_knife 8, v_katana 6) are the AUTHORITATIVE source
  for raw anim indices — the decompile's `a3` is NOT the SendWeaponAnim arg (it's a melee-fn param, a3=0xb
  exceeds v_melee's range). We ship the original's models, so model indices match by construction.

**Weapon table FULLY re-verified** (decompiled all 38 Write_<weapon>; `scripts/extract_weapons.py` is
UNRELIABLE — its `movl $imm,0xOFF(%reg)` regex grabs STACK temps colliding with struct offsets; e.g. the
knife "rate 0.07" was a `[esp+0x18]` store, real `weaponinfo+0x18`=0.4). Field map confirmed (0x04 clip,
0x08 caliber, 0x0c firemodes, 0x18 rate, 0x1c dmg, 0x24 pellets, 0x28 spread, 0x34 recoil, 0x30 view-kick,
0x2c uses-spread, 0xc8 akimbo, 0xcc single, 0x348 firetype). Fixed: knife (clip 18→1, dmg 40→30, **rate
0.07→0.4** — the user's "too fast" bug), katana (dmg 30→45, rate 0.4→0.7, spread 0.1→0.7), skorpion clip
40→20, gun firetypes m4/mp5k/mk23/desert/m16 0→6/9/8/8/6. firemodes/caliber/pellets verified already-correct.
TODO: rewrite extract_weapons.py to read the decompiles (authoritative) instead of the objdump heuristic.

**Dynamic accuracy system RE'd** (CTSGun::StandardFire @0x824a4 + ScaleSpread @0x802a8): per-shot spread
accumulates into CBasePlayer+0x778, effective spread = flSpread(0x28)+accum, grows by flRecoil(0x34)·factor
(factor 2.0, ×0.5 in bullet-time/DoubleFireRate, ×0.775 ducked), capped 0.1; VKickback applies view-punch
of flViewKick(0x30) per shot; 0x2c gates whether ScaleSpread runs. Added flViewKick+bUsesSpread to
s_weapon_info w/ verified values. NOT yet wired: the accumulator's RECOVERY/decay path isn't located yet
(0x778 only grows in ScaleSpread — decay must be in a per-frame path; flagged, not guessed). Next: find the
0x778 decay + RE VKickback's exact kick pattern, then implement the accumulation + view-kick in StandardFire.

## 2026-06-24 (cont. 69v) — knife→glass rework RE-VERIFIED vs ts_i386.so + 3 fidelity fixes

Decompiled the original `CTSKnife` (Spawn @0x6db54, WaitThink @0x6ea30, BounceTouch @0x6decc, WaitTouch
@0x6dce8, CreateKnife @0x6d9e4) + `KnifeFire` @0x74044 via the typed `re.sh` flow and checked the
uncommitted rework line-by-line. **The glass-break core is faithful — every readable constant matches the
binary**: WaitThink (think+0.1, speed>64, 64u velocity sweep, dont_ignore_monsters, flFraction<1, !IsPlayer
[vtbl +0xC8], health ≤ 0.1·speed, TraceAttack(knife_pev, 0.1·speed, dir·64, tr), ApplyMultiDamage(pev,pev));
BounceTouch (owner-ignore, per-type stab 150/100/50, player stab velocity=-0.25·vel + expire+10, worldspawn
speed≥100 && glance[−(normal·dir)<0.4 && normal.z≤0.98] → sparks+sound+velocity·0.5+return, else stick back
off dir·6, other-solid bounce -0.25·vel); Spawn (BOUNCE/BBOX, friction 0.8, gravity 0.85/0.75/0.3, expire+30);
ThrowKnife velocity = v_forward·**1900** (const @0x107f68 = 1900.0, NO player-vel term — confirmed in KnifeFire).

**3 fixes applied to dlls/ts_knife.cpp (build-clean, `T ts_knife` exported, glibc 2.14):**
1. `BounceTouch` now opens with the original's `if (pOther->pev->effects & EF_NODRAW) return;` (orig
   `(char)effects < 0`) — replacing an invented top-level `FClassnameIs("ts_knife")` self-ignore that was in
   the wrong place + skipped the NODRAW gate. 2. Knife-vs-knife ignore RELOCATED to the other-solid branch
   (where the orig's `classname=="knife"` check lives). 3. `StickAt` sets `angles.z = 90` (orig blade-roll).

**Known remaining divergences (intentional / low):** post-contact the orig switches SetTouch→WaitTouch +
gravity→0.75 (we substitute SettleAsPickup/StickAt pickup model); stick uses SOLID_TRIGGER+PickupTouch vs
orig SOLID_NOT+MOVETYPE_FLY; WaitThink dmg bits DMG_CLUB|DMG_NEVERGIB vs orig 0x8001000 (no glass-outcome
change); LINK name "ts_knife" vs orig "knife". **Tooling:** fixed `scripts/ghidra/re.sh` — its `sed` output
filter dropped every multi-line decompile body (only the log-prefixed first line survived); replaced with a
block-aware `_filter` awk helper, so `re.sh <Class>` now prints full typed bodies (how this verify was done).

## 2026-06-24 (cont. 69u) — the "auto-kick" = the JUMP-KICK (RE'd + implemented; user to playtest)

The cont.69t "proximity auto-kick" RE blocker is RESOLVED — and the premise was wrong. User
clarified (with screenshots: a mid-air flying-kick pose + a shattered window): **"Jumping with a
non-kungfu weapon while facing a breakable would kick it. If in kung fu it did NOT kick."** So it's
the **JUMP-KICK**, not the coldcock and not an automatic proximity trigger.

**RE debunked the previous agent's theory:** the "indirect function pointer @0x176858" is just the
normal **PLT/GOT JUMP_SLOT** for CloseCombatAttack — there ARE static callers. CloseCombatAttack
(@0x95f88) is reached from exactly two places: `CCombatAttack__6CTSGun` (bare-hands KUNG-FU, from
Primary/SecondaryAttack only when the active item ptr gun+0xcc==0) and **`CloseAttack__8CTSStunt`
(@0x9c630) = the jump-kick**. (`VKickback`/`DropKickback` are gun RECOIL, not leg kicks. The
coldcock — `AlternateAttack`→`ColdCock`→`ColdCockAttack` via button 0x40/IN_CANCEL — is the +alt2
pistol-whip = task #2, separate.)

**Jump-kick call path:** `CBasePlayer::PreThink` (orig 0x908cc) `if (button & IN_JUMP) Jump()` (same
as ours, player.cpp:2123) → `CBasePlayer::Jump` (orig 0x92864, vtable 0x158) tries
`CTSStunt::CloseAttack` FIRST (kick takes priority over the wall-flip/wheel acrobatics; basic jump
velocity is engine pmove). Called every think while IN_JUMP held → connects mid-flight.

**CTSStunt::CloseAttack RE (stunt obj @ player+0x4f0), all constants recovered** (⚠️ FILE OFFSET =
Ghidra addr − 0x10000; the FP constant pool reads 0 at the naive offset — the .so's DAT_001xxxxx
are .rodata at addr−0x10000; speed scale/thresholds are 8-byte DOUBLES the decompiler truncated):
- gates (return 0 = no kick): stunt-state timers, FL_FROZEN, **active weapon is the tsgun in
  kung-fu mode (id 0x10 && item+0xcc==0)** ← "no kick in kung fu".
- damage = clamp(|velocity| × 1/15, 10, 20) [scale 0.0666667 @0x109b10, lo 10.0 @0x107140, hi 20.0
  @0x107698, floor 10.0 @0x106da4, ceil 20.0 @0x107628]; ×2 if KungFu() power; reach 48.0 @0x106da8.
- hit resolver = CloseCombatAttack via CheckHull (@0x95e28 = TraceLine, then a **head_hull TraceHull
  fallback** = the "auto-connect when roughly facing it" feel); knockback only if damage > 30.0
  @0x107600 (victim shoved at kicker speed + velocity.z=235); EMIT player/closecombat.wav.
- 3rd-person body anim = RANDOM_LONG(0,2)→ids {0:10,1:14,2:13} → HandleCloseCombat (@0x6d8d0) maps
  10/13/14 → **circfront / circback / latback** (player-model kick seqs). Cooldown 0.7s.

**Implemented** (`dlls/ts_gun.cpp` `TSTryJumpKick(CBasePlayer*)`, `#ifndef CLIENT_DLL`-guarded;
decl `dlls/ts_weapons.h`; cooldown `m_flNextJumpKick` in `player.h`; hooked at the top of
`CBasePlayer::Jump` in `dlls/player.cpp` BEFORE the pogo gate so it runs every think). All constants
RE-grounded. Uses GetPlayerTSGun/KungFu/GetGunPosition/m_TSAnim.PlayKungFu(circfront/circback/latback).
**Built clean** server + client (glibc 2.14); TSTryJumpKick in hl.so, correctly ABSENT from client.so
(guarded — it'd otherwise pull the server-only KungFu/UTIL_TraceHull into the prediction build).
Installed to the xash root. **NOT yet playtested — handed to the user to test** (their preference).
Not committed yet (pending playtest).

**Queue still open:** task #2 coldcock viewmodel whip (LAB_10043800/coldcock.sc), #3 predicted
empty/pump/closecombat effects, + katana right-click (KatanaThrow) noted in 69t.

### cont.69u (later) — bullet/breakable/slow-mo/sound RE batch → reference/BULLETS.md (no impl yet)
User opened a new front (bullet penetration, glass shatter, slow-mo bullets, sound pitch). RE'd +
documented in **reference/BULLETS.md**. Key confirmed (LIVE, not dead-code — user confirmed the
bullet behavior is correct):
- **Live fire path = `ShootBulletsPlayer`@0x6f69c** (from StandardFire/ShotgunFire/AkimboFire), NOT
  stock FireBulletsPlayer (= our current gap). It **recurses for PENETRATION**: after a hit, step
  `min(dmg×2, 48)` forward; if `PointContents` past != SOLID (surface thinner than that) → recurse
  (mode 2) to hit the solid beyond. So firing glass breaks it AND hits the wall behind. Dual
  enter+exit decals = TODO (pin the decal sites).
- **Glass shatter** = `Die__10CBreakable`@0x752e0 material switch: case 0 GLASS →
  **gmsgTSCreateDebris** (client SPRITE shower); all others → **TE_BREAKMODEL** (gib MODEL). Exactly
  the user's spec (glass=sprites, wood=model). Shatter dir = attack dir; init vel = this+0x110 ×
  material mult. Client gmsgTSCreateDebris handler + glass sprite + base velocity = TODO RE.
- **Slow-mo bullets-as-models** = `CBulletManager` (rbullet gate: TSGameRules+0x578 slow-PAUSE or
  slow player → tracked-model bullets; else instant hitscan). Both live.
- **Sound pitch** (weapons recorded slow → played fast): fire sound is client-side (FUN_1003dfa0);
  pitch presumably from the slow-mo factor. Mechanism NOT yet pinned — flagged as TODO.
Saved two memories: `ghidra-rodata-const-offset` (file=Ghidra−0x10000, doubles) and
`flag-overriding-and-dead-code` (the user's live-vs-dead RE preference, buy-menu lesson).

### cont.69u (later 2) — ✅ GLASS SPRITE SHATTER implemented (built, awaiting playtest)
RE'd the full glass-shatter pipeline + implemented it:
- **Server** (dlls/func_break.cpp): `CBreakable::Die` for `matGlass` now sends a new `gmsgTSCreateDebris`
  (origin, pev->size, material byte 0, **g_vecAttackDir** = the bullet/attack dir, refpoint, glassfrag
  sprite index, velMag) INSTEAD of TE_BREAKMODEL; other materials keep TE_BREAKMODEL (gib model).
  Precaches `sprites/glassfrag.spr`. (Matches Die@0x752e0 material switch: case 0 glass→message.)
  ⚠️ velMag=150 is a FLAGGED placeholder — the per-pane base (CBreakable+0x110) is a runtime/keyvalue
  value not recovered statically; tune from playtest (user said "discover the init velocity").
- **Client** (cl_dll/ts_debris.{h,cpp}, CHudTSDebris registered in hud.{h,cpp}, added to CMakeLists):
  MsgFunc_TSCreateDebris reads the payload + reconstructs FUN_10047cb0 — a **9×9=81-fragment grid** of
  glassfrag.spr `R_TempSprite`s across the pane FACE (drops the smallest dim = pane normal; centre 0.5,
  step 1/9), each flying in the shatter dir ×velMag with ±15 spread, gravity, FTENT_FADEOUT|GRAVITY|
  COLLIDEWORLD|ROTATE, life RANDOM(2,5)s. Constants RE'd from client.dll (file=VA−0x10000000).
  Both DLLs build clean (glibc 2.14); glassfrag.spr present in the xash ts root; installed.
  **Blend-mode fix (user playtest):** glassfrag.spr is **SPR_ADDITIVE** (texFormat 1) → must use
  **kRenderTransAdd** (black keys out); kRenderTransAlpha showed the black bg. Also the scale was way
  too big (pane-sum/18 → clamped 1.5) → now pane-sum/180 clamped [0.08,0.3] = little shards. General
  rule: match the temp-sprite rendermode to the .spr texFormat (ADDITIVE→TransAdd, ALPHTEST/INDEXALPHA→
  TransAlpha). woodfrag=ALPHTEST + debris_concrete3=INDEXALPHA impact chips already on kRenderTransAlpha.
  **Playtest round 2 fixes (glass + chips):** (1) the .spr files have MULTIPLE FRAMES = different shard
  SHAPES (glassfrag 9, woodfrag 7, debris_concrete3 5); the original picks a RANDOM frame per fragment —
  mine all used frame 0 (identical shapes). Now set `t->entity.curstate.frame = RANDOM(0,nframes-1)`.
  (2) spin rate too low → bumped baseline.angles[2] to ±500°/s (was ±120). (3) velocity too directional
  (all flew one way → clumped on landing) → forward-bias along dir ×0.4 + LARGE per-axis random scatter
  (±velMag*0.6). (4) **direction was BACKWARDS** — glass flew toward the shooter; g_vecAttackDir points
  breakable→attacker (the stock gib code uses -g_vecAttackDir), so the glass message now negates it
  (flies away, the bullet travel dir). Sprite rotation gotcha: xash rolls type-2 (SPR_FWD_PARALLEL)
  sprites only when angles[ROLL]≠0 (gl_sprite.c promotes to _ORIENTED) — so the initial roll must be set.
### cont.69u (later 3) — ✅ BULLET-IMPACT FALLING FRAGMENTS implemented (built, awaiting playtest)
User: "bullet hits spawn sparks + smoke + little fragments that drop to the floor." Smoke+sparks were
already in EV_TSBulletImpact (cont.69t); added the falling chips. RE'd the client impact dispatcher
FUN_10048f60 (switch on texture char) → FUN_10046bd0 (the fragment temp-ent spawner): velocity =
surface-normal×16 + RANDOM(±32) spread, gravity, rotation, ~2-5 chips, short life. Per-material:
**wood/dirt → woodfrag.spr, concrete/default → debris_concrete3.spr**; metal/grate/vent/glass → sparks
(scintille_metal, no chips); flesh/water → none (server blood). Impl: cl_dll/ev_ts.cpp EV_TSBulletImpact
spawns count=RANDOM(2,5) R_TempSprite chips (FTENT_FADEOUT|GRAVITY|COLLIDEWORLD|ROTATE, life 0.8-1.4s) in
the material switch; precached woodfrag/debris_concrete3 server-side (dlls/ts_weapons.cpp). Both build
clean, assets present, installed.

### cont.69u (later 4) — ✅ BULLET PENETRATION + DIVE-THROUGH-GLASS implemented (built, awaiting playtest)
- **Penetration** (dlls/ts_gun.cpp `TSFireBulletsPenetrate`, #ifndef CLIENT_DLL; called from StandardFire
  + AkimboFire server-side, client keeps the prediction FireBulletsPlayer): per pellet, player-synced
  spread then a pierce loop (max 4) — TraceAttack+texture-sound+ENTRY DecalGunshot, then if the hit is a
  brush/world and dmg>5, step `min(dmg*2,48)` forward; if PointContents there ≠ SOLID (thin slice OR an
  entity brush like glass), decal the EXIT/back face + continue the trace (dmg ×0.75). So fire at glass →
  glass breaks AND the round hits the wall behind, bullet-holes on both faces. (orig ShootBulletsPlayer
  @0x6f69c pierce recursion.) Penetration gated to brush surfaces (not players).
- **Dive-through-glass** (dlls/ts_gun.cpp `TSCheckRunThrough`, #ifndef CLIENT_DLL; called every
  CBasePlayer::PreThink): speed≥64 → hull-trace 64u forward ALONG THE VELOCITY direction → TraceAttack the
  hit (damage = speed, ×0.1 grounded vs full airborne) → breaks glass / shoves people, NO kick anim.
  Last-hit guard via new EHANDLE m_hRunThroughLast (player.h). (orig CTSStunt::CheckForBreakables@0x9bd9c.)
- Both build clean (server+client); symbols in hl.so, absent from client.so (guarded); installed.
### cont.69u (later 5) — penetration/knife glass-CHAIN + knife steep-angle (RE'd) + impact-chip polish
- **Bullet chain through multiple glass** (dlls/ts_gun.cpp TSFireBulletsPenetrate): the continuation
  jumped the full pierce-depth (min(dmg*2,48)) past the hit → OVERSHOT a 2nd pane within 48u. Fixed: if
  the surface SHATTERED (pHit->pev->solid==SOLID_NOT after ApplyMultiDamage), continue from just past the
  ENTRY (+1u) so a close next pane is still hit; only jump past the back face for still-solid walls. Cap
  raised 4→8. Whole glass chain now breaks.
- **Knife glass-CHAIN** (dlls/ts_knife.cpp KnifeTouch): was "break 1st pane → trace forward ignore_glass →
  stick in the wall beyond" (skipped every pane past the 1st). Now on a breakable it CAN break, the knife
  KEEPS FLYING (velocity ×0.9/pane); the broken pane is SOLID_NOT so it won't re-touch it → it hits + breaks
  the next pane, chaining until a non-breakable wall.
- **Knife steep-angle no-stick** (RE CTSKnife::BounceTouch@0x7decc): a glancing wall hit DEFLECTS instead of
  sticking — bounce when `-(normal·flyDir) < 0.4` AND `normal.z <= 0.98` (not a flat floor); else stick.
  Constants RE'd (doubles): align 0.4 @0x107ed8, normal.z 0.98 @0x107ed0, speed thresh 100, glance ÷2,
  embed 6. Uses tr.vecPlaneNormal (SDK TraceResult has it; cf. gauss.cpp).
- **Impact chips** (cl_dll/ev_ts.cpp): count 1-3, per-chip random eject speed 120-300 along the normal +
  ±130 spread, kRenderTransAdd (additive=bright; rendercolor only MODULATES so couldn't brighten), no
  FTENT_FADEOUT (abrupt 1s cutoff), random frame (woodfrag 7/concrete 5 shapes), spin ±500.
- **Glass shards** (cl_dll/ts_debris.cpp): random frame (9 shapes — was all frame 0), spin ±500, velocity
  forward-bias ×0.4 + ±velMag*0.6 scatter, dir NEGATED (g_vecAttackDir points at shooter), small scale.

### cont.69u (later 6) — knife glass health/chain/angle + dive-barge airborne gate (RE notes)
- **Walking-breaks-glass FIXED (RE-confirmed):** CheckForBreakables@0x9bd9c line ~46 returns early when
  `pev->flags & FL_ONGROUND` (and the +0x79c stunt flag is 0) → the original ONLY barges through glass
  when AIRBORNE. Our TSCheckRunThrough was missing that gate; added `if (FL_ONGROUND) return;`.
- **Knife glass (dlls/ts_knife.cpp KnifeTouch rewritten as a unified per-surface trace-loop):** ALWAYS
  TraceAttack a breakable it hits → damage ACCUMULATES (weak glass breaks after a few throws; strong/
  high-health glass survives any number — standard CBreakable health). Head-on break → punch through to
  the next pane (whole chain breaks); survived OR glancing → Deflect (reflect+½ speed, keeps the damage).
  Walls stick head-on / deflect glancing.
- **RE flag (faithfulness):** the steep-angle thresholds ARE RE-grounded — BounceTouch@0x7decc bounces
  when `-(normal·flyDir) < 0.4` AND `normal.z <= 0.98` (consts: 0.4 @0x107ed8 dbl, 0.98 @0x107ed0 dbl,
  speed 100, ÷2, embed 6). BUT in the binary that check sits in the **worldspawn (solid wall)** branch;
  BounceTouch's damage path is gated on **IsPlayer (vtable+0xc8)** so only PLAYERS get knife-TraceAttacked
  there — breakables take a separate embed path. So how the original knife damages/chains/angle-deflects
  GLASS isn't fully resolved statically (likely the glass's own engine break-on-touch + physics). I
  implemented the user's OBSERVED behavior using the RE-grounded thresholds + standard CBreakable health;
  applying the angle check to breakables is an extrapolation, flagged to the user.

### cont.69u (later 8) — ⭐ LIVE gdb trace found the knife→glass break path (mechanism = THINK, not touch)
The user is running the ORIGINAL TS in hl.exe under Proton (PID 3844527; mp.dll loaded, Wine maps PE by
RVA — effective base 0x1e13ffb0, i.e. CBreakable::Die RVA 0x4b9a0 → live 0x1e18b950). Attached gdb,
HARDWARE-bp on Die, user threw a knife at glass, captured the stack. **Backtrace (definitive):**
`GetNewDLLFunctions(engine think dispatch) → CTSKnife::WaitThink → [swept-move fn] → CBreakable::TakeDamage
→ CBreakable::Die`. So the thrown knife breaks glass through its **per-frame physics THINK (a swept move
that TakeDamages breakables it crosses)** — NOT through BounceTouch (the touch), and NOT BreakTouch (which
IS IsPlayer-gated, verified: CBreakable vtable+0xc8 reloc → IsPlayer). Our reconstruction breaks glass in
KnifeTouch — the WRONG MECHANISM, which is why it was inconsistent/angle-wrong. RestorePhysics/SavePhysics
(vtable 0x118/0x11c, called by WaitThink) are only slow-mo velocity scaling; the swept-damage fn (the Windows
frame between WaitThink and TakeDamage, unexported) isn't cleanly Linux-mapped yet. **Next:** either rework
the knife to a think-based swept-damage, OR a 2nd live trace (bp on CBreakable::TakeDamage, read the damage
arg + dir) to confirm the exact damage/angle formula. gdb how-to saved in [[flag-unfound-re-early]].
**Method memories saved:** `flag-unfound-re-early` (don't make shit up vs the RE; dynamic gdb trace recipe).

### cont.69u (later 9) — ✅ knife→glass reworked to the ACTUAL implementation (WaitThink swept-break)
Found `WaitThink__8CTSKnife` @0x6ea30 (it WAS in ts_i386.so; I'd missed the grep — the live trace + mp.dll
export name `CTSKnife::WaitThink` pointed right at it). The real rule (RE'd, all constants confirmed):
the knife's in-flight THINK runs every **0.1s** (DAT_00107138), and if speed > **64** (DAT_00107ea0) it
sweeps a **64u forward trace along the velocity**; if it hits a NON-player breakable whose
`health <= 0.1*speed` (DAT_00107138 * speed) it `TraceAttack`s `0.1*speed` (DMG 0x8001000) and breaks it.
**NO angle scaling, NO accumulation** — either the throw kills the pane in one hit or nothing happens.
Reworked dlls/ts_knife.cpp: added `CTSKnife::WaitThink` (the sweep) + `SweepBreak` (the shared one-hit
rule), Spawn now SetThink(WaitThink)@0.1s + a 15s expire; KnifeTouch simplified — stab flesh / break-and-
fly-through if SweepBreak succeeds / **bounce off (0.25*-vel) if too strong** / stick-or-deflect walls.
Removed the invented angle-scaled + accumulation + energy-falloff chain. Built clean, installed.
**Docs:** added CLAUDE.md **§4b** (live gdb trace + mp.dll cross-ref method) next to the Ghidra flow;
enriched the `flag-unfound-re-early` memory. mp.dll Ghidra project at recovered/ghidra/mpdll.
**TODO (user): if this plays right, audit docs/ledger for other "couldn't find / made-shit-up" spots and
re-RE them via the mp.dll/live-trace method.**

### cont.69u (later 7) — knife↔glass behavior reworked to the user's observation (RE caveat noted)
RE'd the glass-break paths fully: **CBreakable::BreakTouch@0xc0c44** (velocity break-on-touch) is gated on
`pOther->IsPlayer()`, and **CTSKnife::BounceTouch@0x7decc**'s only TraceAttack/damage path is ALSO gated on
IsPlayer — so a thrown knife never breaks glass via either in the binary (breakable → bounce-off + fall;
ShouldCollide just returns 1). The knife→glass BREAK path is NOT statically locatable. User corrected: knives
break glass head-on OR **fall straight down if they can't** — they NEVER stick in glass; and they usually
break ONE pane then **drop at the second** (energy loss per pane). Implemented (dlls/ts_knife.cpp KnifeTouch):
ANGLE-SCALED damage `m_flDamage * -(normal·flyDir)` (head-on full → breaks weak glass; glancing chips;
accumulates), break → punch through to the next surface with **dmg ×0.5 per pane** (so it rarely chains
past ~two), survive → **fall straight down** (kill horizontal velocity + back off the pane; lands as a floor
pickup). Walls keep the RE-grounded stick-head-on / deflect-glancing (0.4/0.98). Flagged: the knife-breaks-
glass mechanic itself isn't byte-faithful (couldn't locate it) — modeled on the observation + RE'd angle/health.

- ⚠️ Remaining queue: **sound pitch** (recorded-slow/played-fast) still needs the focused client decompile
  (FUN_1003dfa0 sound-play pitch vs the slow-mo factor) — flagged, not pinned. Plus #2 coldcock viewmodel
  whip, #3 predicted empty/pump/closecombat, katana right-click throw.

- **glass break paths (RE'd):** (1) shoot it → CBulletManager/ShootBulletsPlayer TraceAttack (penetration
  also lets the bullet continue to the wall behind); (2) jump NEXT to it → the jump-kick (CloseAttack,
  kick anim); (3) **dive/run INTO it fast → CTSStunt::CheckForBreakables@0x9bd9c** (per-think from
  PreThink: speed≥64 → velocity-direction hull trace 64u → TraceAttack damage=speed; no kick anim =
  "jump before reaching it, shatter, dive through"). #3 documented in reference/BULLETS.md, NOT yet impl
  (new task #6).

## 2026-06-23 (cont. 69s) — .sc client weapon-param subsystem: steps 1+2 (table shared + deploy cache)

Started the FULL client weapon-param subsystem (the cont.69r NEXT TASK). Steps 1 & 2 done +
in-engine verified. Committed as **fa44c26** (one commit for both steps — ev_ts.cpp +
cl_dll/CMakeLists.txt straddle both, so a clean split would need non-buildable intermediates).
NOTE: committed with `--no-gpg-sign` (user authorized "just commit skipping gpg" after the
gpg-agent passphrase cache expired mid-session + pinentry timed out headless). Re-sign later if
the unsigned commit matters.

**Step 1 — shared s_weapon_info table into the client.** Split the pure weapon DATA layer
(tsweapon_t, s_weapon_info, get_weapon_info, the per-caliber ammo/fire-mode helpers) out of
dlls/ts_weapons.{h,cpp} into a new SHARED TU dlls/ts_weapon_info.{h,cpp}, built into BOTH hl.so
and client.so (the original keeps a client copy at DAT_100aa050 via a client compile_weapons_info
mirror — we share one TU). ts_weapons.{h,cpp} now hold only the server-only PrecacheAllTSWeapons.
ev_ts.cpp muzzle-grip reads get_weapon_info()->pszAnimExt (was a duplicated local array). Verified:
both build (glibc 2.14), get_weapon_info linked into client.so, M4 fires + flare draws in-engine.

**Step 2 — the active-weapon param cache (client) + draw event.** RE'd the handler architecture
(client.dll Ghidra): each handler caches its args at entry (FUN_100425b0 draw / FUN_10042690 reload:
type=iparam1, info=get_weapon_info(type), barrelMask=iparam2, entindex=args+4, origin/angles/vel);
the fire handler FUN_1003de40 dispatches on the fire-type byte weapon_info+0xd2 (==our iFireType:
1=pump, 4/5=akimbo, else standard) — so the WEAPON TYPE TRAVELS IN THE EVENT. The ~70 DAT_10189xxx
globals are the client's INTERNAL prediction state, NOT the protocol. **The contract = event NAME +
iparam/fparam/bparam packing** (reload also packs fparam1=stage 0/9/10). Per CLAUDE.md (behaviour,
not byte) the cache is a clean modern struct, not a 70-global byte-port. Full RE in reference/EVENTS.md
"cont.69s".
- cl_dll/ts_weapon_predict.{h,cpp}: `struct TSActiveWeapon {type, info, barrelMask, entindex,
  origin/angles/velocity, isLocal; UpdateFromEvent(args);}` + global g_tsActive + EV_TSDraw (draw.sc
  handler = seeds the cache). EV_TSFire now refreshes g_tsActive too. draw.sc hooked in hl_events.cpp.
- Server (ts_gun.cpp): m_usDraw precached; Deploy() plays draw.sc ADDITIVELY (iparam1=type,
  iparam2=akimbo barrel mask 2/4/6 else 1) — keeps the server DefaultDeploy visuals, only primes
  client state. Verified in-engine: deploys (knife/M4) fire the draw event, NO crash, no bad-event
  errors, fire path unchanged.

**Step 3 — ⚠️ anim-prediction BLOCKED (in-engine proven), decision needed.** Tried porting reload
as a predicted event (EV_TSReload → EV_WeaponAnimation, replacing the server SendWeaponAnim).
In-engine: the clip refilled (server reload ran) but the reload viewmodel anim NEVER played across
~1.8s. Root cause: our CTSGun is server-authoritative + not registered in the client weapon-
prediction loop, and CLIENT_WEAPONS is defined, so HUD_WeaponsPostThink overwrites any predicted
viewmodel anim every frame. (The fire event's local effects DO work, so EV_IsLocal is fine — it's
specifically EV_WeaponAnimation that can't stick. Matches the long-standing EV_TSFire comment.)
**Experiment reverted** (reload back to SendWeaponAnim, no regression); finding documented in
reference/EVENTS.md "cont.69s — anim-prediction BLOCKED" + a code note at CTSGun::Reload.

**The real fork (user decision):**
- (A) Port only the SOUND/EFFECT half of each event (drop-in arg packing + sprites/shells/punch/
  temp-entities), anims stay SendWeaponAnim. Low value — EV_TSFire already covers the main effect
  case and SendWeaponAnim already triggers the models' embedded reload/clip sound events.
- (B) Make CTSGun CLIENT-PREDICTED first (a client weapon object in HUD_InitClientWeapons /
  HUD_WeaponsPostThink / HUD_GetWeaponData, mirroring CTSGun clip/timers/state) — the real gate for
  faithful predicted anims, and a large separate effort. Then the 11 handlers predict properly.
- (C) Stop at the foundation (steps 1+2 shipped); revisit prediction later.

Steps 1+2 (committed 1cf2499) stand regardless — the shared table + the active-weapon cache are
prerequisites for (B) too.

**User chose (B) — make CTSGun client-predicted.** Progress:
- **3a DONE (committed bb0594f)** — dlls/ts_gun.cpp now compiles INTO client.so (added to
  cl_dll/CMakeLists, like the HL weapon .cpp files). It compiled unchanged; only failed to LINK
  vs server-only symbols (TSCreateWorldGun/AmmoPack/ThrowM61, CTSAnimation::Animate/PlayKungFu,
  PrecacheAllTSWeapons, DoubleFireRate, DispatchSpawn/Touch) → new cl_dll/ts_gun_stubs.cpp gives
  client no-op stubs (server-authoritative side-effects the prediction must skip; none on the
  hot path). ZERO edits to ts_gun.cpp. 35 CTSGun methods now in client.so. Infra only — nothing
  runs the client CTSGun yet; client loads+spawns+fires fine.
- **3b/3c SCAFFOLDED (committed 98fa78e), DISABLED pending debug.** Built the whole harness:
  extracted the CTSGun class to dlls/ts_gun.h; added CTSGun::GetWeaponData/SetWeaponData (ship
  weapon TYPE=iuser1, active-caliber RESERVE=iuser2, fire-mode=iuser3; clip/timers/m_fInReload ship
  generically); added the client g_TSGun + HUD_PrepEntity + the HUD_WeaponsPostThink TSGUN_WEAPON_ID
  case in cl_dll/hl/hl_weapons.cpp. UseDecrement() gates it.
  - **Enabled it and tested in-engine — NOT correct, so left DISABLED (UseDecrement=false +
    registration COMMENTED OUT; runtime verified unchanged / no regression):** prediction RAN
    (ItemPostFrame client-side) but (a) the predicted viewmodel anim STILL didn't stick (fire +
    reload stayed in the idle pose — reload frames pixel-identical), and (b) fire effects DOUBLED
    (muzzle/shells, no event dedup). No crash (EMIT_SOUND = client no-op via hl_baseentity.cpp;
    MESSAGE_BEGIN only in UpdateClientData/SendWeaponStatus, NOT on the prediction path).
  - **To re-enable:** flip UseDecrement→true + uncomment the 2 registration lines in hl_weapons.cpp.
  - **ROOT CAUSE FOUND (Con_Printf-instrumented HUD_WeaponsPostThink, then reverted).** 3b/3c are
    actually CORRECT: ItemPostFrame runs client-side for id 16, gates pass, SetWeaponData mirrors
    right (wpnType=5/clip/reserve). The bug is a **TIME-BASE mismatch**: the engine decrements a
    UseDecrement weapon's m_flNextPrimaryAttack as a RELATIVE countdown each client frame (observed
    37.92→37.85 while client time rose), but CTSGun uses ABSOLUTE gpGlobals->time → timers corrupt →
    predicted attack gate misfires → SendWeaponAnim never driven (animBefore==animAfter==0) → idle
    viewmodel = "anim doesn't stick". CTSGun uses absolute time because **CLIENT_WEAPONS is defined
    GLOBALLY** (CMakeLists, both hl+client targets) making UTIL_WeaponTimeBase()==0 on the server too
    — cont.69q's gpGlobals->time was the workaround, which is incompatible with prediction.
  - **✅ FIXED + ENABLED (committed ee642ab) — CTSGun is now CLIENT-PREDICTED, anims stick.** The fix
    was NOT to rescope CLIENT_WEAPONS (it must stay global — the server needs it for GetWeaponData +
    the CBasePlayer::ItemPostFrame decrement loop @player.cpp:2823, gated `#if CLIENT_WEAPONS` +
    `gun->UseDecrement()`). The real fix: revert CTSGun's 34 timer sites gpGlobals->time →
    UTIL_WeaponTimeBase() (0-base; the 4 real-time deltas m_lastCCTime/m_blockBar keep gpGlobals->time).
    With UseDecrement()==true the server decrement loop now decrements CTSGun's 0-base timers (cont.69q's
    absolute-time workaround was only needed because UseDecrement was false). Re-enabled UseDecrement +
    the g_TSGun registration. Fire/akimbo events → FEV_NOTHOST so the predicting host plays its own
    predicted muzzle/shell (no double).
  - **Verified in-engine** (Con_Printf, removed): `cl: StandardFire`/`cl: Reload` run client-side;
    predicted clip decrements; fire (slide) + reload viewmodel anims ANIMATE (were static); SINGLE
    muzzle (dedup works); server fires repeatedly (no fire-once-stuck). No crash. Both DLLs build.
  - **TEST-HARNESS NOTE for next agent:** the buy/select is flaky under blind xdotool — `tkw`/`weapon_N`
    didn't reliably wield the M4 (random loadout auto-selects the highest-priority owned weapon, often a
    knife). What worked: spawn (click through the gate 3-4×), then `drop` ×2 in console to shed the
    melee and auto-select an owned GUN. Then fire (MOUSE1=+attack; note ENTER is ALSO +attack).
  - **✅ DEDICATED-SERVER firing pass DONE (no regression).** Ran the ReHLDS rig (metamod+rcbot,
    `~/Containers/hlds/hlds-linux64-test`, ts_wyndham, bots) with a TEMP bot-give hook (M4 + ammo +
    `m_iClip=2` in TSDeployArsenal) + TEMP server `[TSSRV]` fire/reload probes — pure server-side, NO
    client prediction. Result: bots fire the M4 in sustained full-auto (clip 29→3, 70 events) AND the
    full empty→reload→refill cycle works (`fire clip=0 → reload → fire clip=29 → fire 28…`, 52 fire/5
    reload). No fire-once-stuck, no crash. So the UTIL_WeaponTimeBase()+UseDecrement 0-base holds on a
    pure dedicated server (the player.cpp:2823 decrement loop drives it). Temp probes + bot-give
    REVERTED (`git checkout dlls/ts_gun.cpp`); clean hl.so restored to the rig. Tree = ee642ab.
  - **3e DONE (committed 62d754e) — filled the 1st-person melee/grenade gaps the prediction exposed.**
    Audited the .sc actions: most were already covered once anims predict (fire/reload via SendWeaponAnim,
    empty via the client PlayEmptySound click, pump reload anim, kung-fu CloseCombat). The genuine GAPS:
    knife/katana/sealknife MeleeAttack + GrenadeThrow set only the 3rd-person body anim, never
    SendWeaponAnim → silent, unanimated 1st-person. Fixed: MeleeAttack SendWeaponAnim the slash seq
    (v_knife slash1=3, v_katana/v_sealknife slash1=2 — dumped from the .mdl headers via scratchpad/
    dumpseq.py) + swing/surface/flesh sounds (weapons/knife/*, weapons/katana/*, precached); GrenadeThrow
    SendWeaponAnim(3)=v_m61 throw. FIXED slash (not random) to stay in lockstep with the server's anim
    (random would snap on the reconcile). Verified in-engine: knife slash animates (was static) + sounds,
    no crash. coldcock left server-driven (its viewmodel is the held gun's — no reliable whip seq).
  - **The .sc client weapon-param subsystem (cont.69r NEXT TASK) is COMPLETE:** shared table (1) +
    param cache (2) + CTSGun client-prediction (3a-3d, anims stick, dedicated-verified) + melee/grenade
    predicted anims (3e). Remaining nice-to-haves (not blocking): byte-faithful knife.sc impact spark/
    decal (FUN_10046f50/100492b0), coldcock viewmodel whip, predicted-EFFECT events for the rest.
- **3d** — verify the predicted reload/fire viewmodel anim STICKS (re-run the cont.69s test).
- **3e** — then port the 11 .sc handlers as predicted (now that anims stick), OR — if prediction
  proves too fragile — note that once anims stick via SendWeaponAnim, the .sc events are only needed
  for the muzzle-sprite/shell EFFECTS (EV_TSFire already does those), so 3e may be minimal.

## 2026-06-24 (cont. 69t) — weapon-effect polish batch (impacts/knife-spark/knife-throw) + RE notes

After the .sc prediction subsystem (cont.69s), a user-requested polish batch. All RE-grounded, in-engine
verified, committed:
- **Bullet impact smoke** (8430ea3) — client EV_TSBulletImpact: a SMOKE puff per surface material at
  the bullet hit (RE: client dispatcher FUN_10048f60 — wood/dirt→wood_smoke_add, metal/glass/grate/vent/
  computer→gun_smoke_add+R_SparkShower, concrete/default→gun_smoke, flesh→none). The server side already
  did damage+texture sound+decal+blood; this adds the missing VISUAL. Centre-ray trace; predicted via
  the fire event. Verified: floor/wall impacts puff smoke.
- **knife.sc melee spark** (6876988) — MeleeAttack plays events/knife.sc (m_usMelee, FEV_NOTHOST, impact
  in the origin) on a non-flesh surface hit; client EV_TSMelee R_SparkShower. (RE: FUN_10043c90.)
- **Knife right-click THROW** (dee455c) — RE'd CTSGun::SecondaryAttack@0x817a8 (fire-type KNIFE→KnifeFire
  throw branch) + CreateKnife@0x6d9e4. New dlls/ts_knife.cpp = CTSKnife projectile (per-type w_model,
  MOVETYPE_TOSS + avelocity tumble, damages a victim / thunks a surface, drops a recoverable CTSWorldGun).
  CTSGun::ThrowKnife (spends m_iClip, throw seq v_knife 7 / v_sealknife 5, knife_miss whoosh, auto-switch
  when dry), routed from ItemPostFrame IN_ATTACK2 (gated m_flNextSecondaryAttack). TSThrowKnife + client
  stub. Verified: right-click → throw anim + CTSKnife spawns (w_knife.mdl), no crash.
- **Breakable shatter particles — ALREADY WORKS, no change.** Verified on ts_kissmeyerbasic: punching/
  shooting glass → it breaks + `glassgibs.mdl` loads. Stock HL CBreakable::Die (dlls/func_break.cpp) emits
  TE_BREAKMODEL with the material gib (m_idShard = glassgibs/woodgibs/… by m_Material) + count=0 (engine
  fills the brush volume = covers the surface) + the BREAK_GLASS/WOOD flag. TS uses stock CBreakable (no
  override). If denser coverage is wanted, bump the TE_BREAKMODEL count.

**cont.69t follow-ups (user feedback, committed c16e960):**
- Knife throw COLLISION (RE: CTSKnife::BounceTouch@0x6decc) — STICK into non-breakable non-flesh
  surfaces (embed + point the way it flew); BOUNCE off a breakable it can't break; break-through a
  breakable it CAN break + stick in the wall beyond (forward trace w/ ignore_glass); flesh = stab +
  drop a recoverable knife. **Fixed a server CRASH** (Host_Error "trigger in clipping list") — StickAt
  set pev->solid=SOLID_TRIGGER without relinking; now sets solid+size and relinks (UTIL_SetSize/Origin).
- Pickup = press-E (IN_USE) in a trigger radius, NOT run-over, matching CTSWorldGun::WaitTouch (no aim).
- Dropped-weapon GLOW = WHITE kRenderFxGlowShell (CTSWorldGun + stuck knife) — model shell, not a light.
  (User-corrected: white not orange; E-pickup not run-over.)

**STILL QUEUED (user-requested, RE notes for the next session):**
- **Proximity auto-kick (non-kung-fu)** — "any weapon except kung-fu auto-kicks when next to + aiming at
  a breakable/person." RE is HARD: the kick is `CloseCombatAttack__11CBasePlayer` (@0x95f88) called via an
  INDIRECT function pointer (PTR_CloseCombatAttack…@0x176858) — static caller not found. The per-frame
  trigger (proximity + aim check) isn't in CTSGun::PrimaryAttack (0x81a20, pure fire-type dispatch) and
  CTSGun has no ItemPostFrame symbol (uses base). Kick helpers RE'd: VKickback@0x80414,
  GetCloseCombatVectors@0x86e2c, DropKickback@0x86e9c, GaitCloseCombat. NEXT: trace the indirect ptr / find
  the CBasePlayer think that calls it; don't guess the range/damage (RE-ground it).
- **Coldcock viewmodel whip** — ColdCock has the hit sound + 3rd-person anim but no 1st-person SendWeaponAnim;
  most gun v_models lack a whip seq. RE coldcock.sc (LAB_10043800) for the seq it uses (may be a generic).
- **Predicted-effect events for empty/pump/closecombat** — low value (anims already predict; empty already
  clicks via PlayEmptySound; pump scock1 + closecombat sounds are server-side EMIT_SOUND).
- **Katana right-click** = KatanaThrow (separate from the knife throw) — not yet done.

## 2026-06-23 (cont. 69r) — committed the batch; chose the FULL .sc client-prediction subsystem as next

Committed everything (git): **1ca0ca4** (akimbo refactor + kung-fu + all playtest fixes — cont.69p/q),
**c675ef0** (reference/EVENTS.md = complete RE map of the 11 .sc weapon events, both sides), **7a66e5c**
(EVENTS.md = client weapon-param subsystem foundation + build order).

RE'd the `.sc` event system end-to-end: the files are empty 4-byte hooks; server `PLAYBACK_EVENT` <-> client
`pfnHookEvent` handler. Map in EVENTS.md — server handles (CTSGun::Precache@0x80660: fire+0x964 … grenade
+0x978), client hook->handler (FUN_10003240: fire->FUN_1003de40, reload->LAB_10042690, closecombat->FUN_10043200,
… 11 total), playback sites. Only `events/fire.sc` is wired today (EV_TSFire); the rest are server-driven.

**User decision:** do the FULL client weapon-param subsystem (byte-faithful), not the simplified per-event
path. Foundation RE'd: client `get_weapon_info` = FUN_100071c0 -> DAT_100aa050 (the SAME 988-byte
s_weapon_info[38] the server builds) + the DAT_10189xxx active-param cache (filled on deploy, read by the
handlers). Build order (EVENTS.md): (1) client weapon table, (2) deploy param-cache, (3) the 11 handlers.
NOT started (deferred to a focused session — it touches the working weapon code). Added scripts/ghidra/
FindStr.java (find a .data string + its xrefs). See HANDOFF "NEXT TASK".

## 2026-06-23 (cont. 69p) — akimbo OWNERSHIP refactor IMPLEMENTED + 3 playtest fixes

Implemented the user-approved akimbo-ownership refactor (the cont.69o hand-off). CTSGun's arsenal
migrated from the compact `m_arsenalType[]` list to the original's **items[]-by-tsweapon_t model**
(`struct TSItem m_items[TSW_COUNT]` = {owned, clip, leftClip, rightClip, mode, attach, barrelMask}),
all RE-grounded (TakeWeapon@0x80a04, CTSGun::DropWeapon@0x8094c, CBasePlayer::DropWeapon@0x84900,
SwitchItems=FUN_00081564, GetBetterWeapon@0x80f40, IsWeaponAkimbo/IsOnlyAkimbo = fireType 4/5,
g_iWeaponPriority extracted from compile_weapons_info). dlls/ts_gun.cpp + ts_weapons.h + client.cpp.
- **Combine keeps BOTH owned** (TakeWeapon): own single + pick up another → fill items[akimbo]
  (leftClip = items[single].clip, rightClip = weapon_info[single].clip), single NOT cleared. Scroll
  skips the single (akimbo owned), slot1-5 still selects it. **Verified in-engine** (`tsbuy 2` ×2 →
  akimbo berettas in hand; slot2 → single beretta while still owning the akimbo).
- **Drop branches** (CBasePlayer::DropWeapon, now all in TSDropWeapon): combinable akimbo → throw 2
  base singles (clip/2 each) + remove both items[akimbo]/[single]; **single dropped while owning its
  akimbo → throw 1, keep the single (clip = akimbo.rightClip), remove the akimbo** (the cont.69o
  REMAINING item) — **verified in-engine**; plain → throw 1 + remove. GetBetterWeapon auto-selects by
  g_iWeaponPriority. world-gun spawning moved server-side into TSDropWeapon.
- **useitems** (SwitchItems) cycles the active akimbo's barrel mask 0→2(L)→4(R)→6(both)→0; AkimboFire
  decrements per-barrel clips honouring the mask; reload redistributes across barrels.
- SelectWeaponType (holster→deploy), lastinv, WStatus, death-scatter, pickup all keyed by type now.

**3 playtest fixes (all user-reported, RE-grounded, rebuilt):**
1. **Spawn→spectate bounce was NOT a code bug** — the test launch missed `+deathmatch 1 +maxplayers`,
   so the listenserver ran single-player rules and stock `respawn()` (client.cpp) does
   `SERVER_COMMAND("reload")` → endless map-reload loop (looked like a crash; gdb caught no SIGSEGV).
   Confirmed: committed build does the same; `+deathmatch 1` → spawns clean. **CLAUDE.md §3 launch
   command updated** to require the flags.
2. **Kung-fu no longer drawn red** in the weapon-select bar (cl_dll/ts_weaponbar.cpp): the empty-clip
   red tint now only applies to weapons with maxClip > 0 (clipless melee has no ammo to be out of).
3. **Dropped weapons no longer block the player while falling** — RE confirmed (CTSWorldGun::Spawn
   @0xa0954) the original gives the FALLING gun a ZERO-size bbox (SetSize DAT_00106a08=0.0), so the
   SOLID_BBOX point drops+lands but the player walks through (it damages via the Fall trace, not
   collision); real trigger size only on landing. ts_worldgun.cpp falling SetSize → g_vecZero.

Built hl.so + client.so (glibc 2.14), staged via setup-xash-mod, in-engine verified (no crashes,
0 reconnects with +deathmatch 1). NOT yet committed. Remaining: exhaustive 38-weapon retest.

**Follow-up fixes (same batch, user playtest):**
4. **Loadout now PERSISTS across spawns** — removed the `ResetArmament()` we had added at the end of
   `CBasePlayer::BuyArmament()` (ts_buy.cpp). The original BuyArmament@0x83f10 does NOT reset, so the
   chosen loadout re-applies on every spawn (respawn + round restart). rst_cfg still clears on rebuy.
   Fixes "round restart gives zero weapons".
5. **No more phantom beretta** — `CTSGun` default `m_weaponType` changed TSW_BERETTA → **TSW_MELEE**, so
   a bare `weapon_tsgun` (GiveNamedItem) is just kung-fu; the loadout supplies the real guns.
7. **FIRING fixed (fire-once-then-stuck, reload never refilled)** — the build defines CLIENT_WEAPONS so
   `UTIL_WeaponTimeBase()` == 0 (a 0-based predicted clock). The original CTSGun is client-predicted, but
   our reconstruction drives it SERVER-authoritatively, so every CTSGun timer compared a positive
   `m_flNextPrimaryAttack`/`m_flTimeWeaponIdle`/reload time against 0 → never elapsed → one shot then
   permanently stuck, reload anim played but clip/reserve never updated. Converted all CTSGun timers to
   `gpGlobals->time` (and `GetNextAttackDelay(x)` → `gpGlobals->time + x`). In-engine verified: M4 full-auto
   sustained fire (muzzle flash + brass), reload refills.
9. **MUZZLE-FLASH "flares" added (were not drawn)** — RE of client.dll: the muzzle flash is the TS
   sprite drawn at the gun muzzle ATTACHMENT by `FUN_100474b0` (loads `sprites/ts_muzzleflash1h.spr` =
   one-handed, `ts_muzzleflash6.spr` = two-handed; a 2nd flare when `weapon_info+0x350` is set). Our
   EV_TSFire only did the engine EF_MUZZLEFLASH (and akimbo fired no event at all). Now `EV_TSMuzzleFlare`
   draws the TS sprite via `R_TempSprite` at the viewmodel/player `attachment[side]` (per-grip sprite),
   and AkimboFire fires `events/fire.sc` with `iparam2 = barrel side` so each akimbo barrel flares at
   attachment 0/1 (gold colts = akimbo-only, both barrels). Sprites precached in PrecacheAllTSWeapons.
   In-engine verified (beretta flare at the muzzle). NOTE: a faithful approximation — the original's exact
   multi-segment temp-sprite build (FUN_100474b0, scale from weapon_info+0x1c/+0x354/+0x358) is not fully
   reproduced; flare scale/offset may need tuning. SHOTGUN incremental reload (ShotgunReload@0x84aac, per-
   shell state machine) still TODO.
8. **BATCHED LOADOUT fixed (selected arsenal not given)** — RE of the buy-menu apply (client.dll
   FUN_10039400) shows it builds ONE space-separated command `"tkw "` + `"%i_%i "` per weapon
   (`tkw 2_1 5_1 9_1`) + one `tka …`, sent via a single ClientCmd. Our server `tkw`/`tki`/`tka` handlers
   only parsed `CMD_ARGV(1)` → dropped all but the first weapon. Fixed to loop `CMD_ARGV(1..ARGC-1)`.
   With the persist fix (#4) the full loadout now applies on every spawn + round restart. In-engine
   verified (batched `tkw 2_1 5_1 9_1 13_1` → all given). BUY.md note corrected (was wrong: "single token").

6. **Can't-fire / no-viewmodel fixed (regression from #5)** — the engine's auto-deploy (GetNextBestWeapon)
   skips kung-fu (melee, no clip), so with a kung-fu default the tsgun never became `m_pActiveItem` →
   no viewmodel + ItemPostFrame (firing) never ran. Added **`TSDeployArsenal(player)`** (ts_gun.cpp,
   called at the end of CTSGameRules::PlayerSpawn) which forces the tsgun active + Deploy()s; also made
   `SelectWeaponType` claim `m_pActiveItem` when none is set. **In-engine verified**: M4 viewmodel
   deploys, loadout pistol deploys on spawn, 0 reconnects. (Before this, BERETTA default masked the bug
   because the engine auto-deployed a gun.)

## 2026-06-23 (cont. 69q) — kung-fu close-combat, shotgun reload, muzzle flares, fire/loadout/deploy fixes

Big playtest-driven batch (all RE-grounded; in-engine where verifiable):
- **CanDeploy fix** — TS weapons keep ammo in our own m_ammoReserve, not stock m_rgAmmo, so the stock
  CBasePlayerWeapon::CanDeploy refused to deploy any empty-clip TS weapon — notably KUNG-FU (always 0
  clip), which then kept the PREVIOUS weapon's viewmodel ("kung-fu takes prev model" / "round restart
  strips kung-fu"). `CTSGun::CanDeploy()` now returns true. Verified: weapon_0 → fists.
- **KUNG-FU close-combat** (`CCombatAttack__6CTSGun`@0x86078): kung-fu = bare hands (original has gun+0xcc==0
  → CCombatAttack). PrimaryAttack/Secondary for TSW_MELEE now route to `CloseCombatAttack()` — a contextual
  dispatch from pev->button (IN_ATTACK/IN_ATTACK2 + IN_DUCK) + FL_ONGROUND/FL_DUCKING + velocity → the
  v_melee.mdl anims (0x0d-0x19) + damage 35/45/55: right-click+duck=handstand kick(0x14), right-click=back-
  kick(0x11), fire+air+duck=dropkick(0x10), fire+air=flying punch(0x12), fire+duck=uppercut(0x16),
  fire=ground punch combo(0x0d/0e/0f). Sounds (RE: player/*): flesh→kungfuhit.wav, surface→closecombat.wav
  swing + pl_step* footstep, miss→closecombat.wav swing. (SLICE: exact knockback/reach consts approximated.)
- **SHOTGUN incremental reload** (ShotgunReload@0x84aac): pump shotguns (fireType TSFT_PUMP: m3/spas12/
  mossberg) now reload ONE shell at a time (per-shell delay, scock1.wav), interruptible by firing.
- **MUZZLE FLARES** (RE: client.dll FUN_100474b0 + ts_muzzleflash1h/6 sprites): EV_TSMuzzleFlare draws the
  TS flash sprite at the gun muzzle attachment (akimbo per-barrel via iparam2). Flare life shortened (was
  "slow enough to walk around" — dropped FTENT_SPRCYCLE, life 0.01).
- **FIRING** (server-time gate, was fire-once-stuck) + **batched-loadout** (tkw loops all argv) + **loadout
  persists** (no ResetArmament) + **deploy** (TSDeployArsenal) — see cont.69p notes above; all RE-grounded.
- **ROUND-RESTART WEAPON LOSS fixed (recurring bug)** — `CBasePlayer::Spawn` does NOT call
  RemoveAllItems, so TSRestartRound respawning a STILL-ALIVE player left the old weapon_tsgun in place
  and GiveNamedItem made a SECOND one; the two tsguns fought over active/WStatus → the arsenal
  "disappeared" inconsistently (all-but-one / all). Fixed: CTSGameRules::PlayerSpawn now
  `RemoveAllItems(false)` before GiveNamedItem so the round-restart re-equip is clean (one tsgun).
- **KUNG-FU anims FIXED** — our v_melee.mdl has only 11 seqs (idle/draw/punch_left/punch_right/block_low/
  kick/sidekick/uppercut/spinkick/backkick/punch_right2); I'd used the original's 0x0d-0x19 which don't
  exist → no animation. Remapped CloseCombatAttack to our seqs (punch combo 2/3/10, uppercut 7, kick 5,
  sidekick 6, spinkick 8, backkick 9). Reload "hooah" block → block_low (4).
- **KUNG-FU reload block IMPLEMENTED** — CloseCombatBlock: R plays player/block.wav ("hooah") + block_low
  stance + gates attacks; a stamina bar (~3 blocks, regens) → player/breathe2.wav (the Valve breathing)
  when spammed empty. Sounds in ts/sound/player/.
- **`thirdperson` is now a TOGGLE** (cl_dll/in_camera.cpp CAM_ToThirdPerson): flips third↔first; `firstperson`
  stays one-way.
- **Kung-fu 3rd-person held-weapon removed** — CTSGun::Deploy fell back to the VIEW model when a weapon had
  no p_model, so kung-fu (no p_model) put v_melee on the player's hands/back (a phantom held gun). Now an
  empty weaponmodel ("") → bare hands. NOTE: the player BODY kung-fu animation (punch/kick on the 3rd-person
  model) needs kung-fu sequences in the player model + the CTSAnimation close-combat gait (GaitCloseCombat/
  HandleCloseCombat@0x5d8d0); the current player model (SpeziClaus) only has onehanded/twohanded/akimbo aim
  sets — no fist set — so the body can't punch visually with it. Deferred (model-dependent).
- **KUNG-FU dispatch reworked + 3rd-person BODY anims** (user rules): FIRE = PUNCHES only (never kicks,
  even with jump) — duck→uppercut, hold/rapid→punch combo (punchleft/right/air sequence), lone tap→single
  regular punch; +ATTACK2 = KICKS only — jump+duck→spinkick, duck→sidekick, back→backkick, else→kick. The
  player models DO carry the kung-fu sequences by NAME (gordon: punchleft/punchright/punchair/uppercut/
  sidekick/backkick/circkick/circspin/kungfu_block1, …) — added `CTSAnimation::PlayKungFu(player, seq)` and
  each attack/block now plays its body sequence (held via the aim-timer) so 3rd-person shows the punch/kick,
  not an aim pose. (Earlier model-parse used the wrong regex and missed these; the named seqs exist.)
- **STILL TODO (RE'd, not implemented):** kung-fu reload = `CCombatBlock`@0x85ebc — a "hooah" taunt
  (event gun+0x96c, anim 0x26) that blocks attacks (sets gun+0x9c/0xa0) + consumes stamina (player melee
  bar, UpdateMeleeBar); spamming → low-stamina breathing sound. The closecombat client event handler
  (FUN_10043200) for the swing-anim prediction. The flare multi-segment build (FUN_100474b0 exact).

## 2026-06-23 (cont. 69o) — full akimbo-ownership model RE'd (refactor handed to next agent)

User asked to ground the akimbo logic in RE and (after I flagged the scope) chose to do the full refactor;
we decided to hand the IMPLEMENTATION to the next agent (this session was already very long). The complete
model is RE'd + documented in reference/WEAPON_SELECT.md ("Akimbo ownership model" + "TakeWeapon combine"):
TakeWeapon@0x80a04 (combine: akimbo item carries two barrel clips +0x130/+0x134; KEEPS both items[single]
and items[akimbo] owned), DropWeapon@0x84900 (drop akimbo → 2× base single), SwitchItems=FUN_00081564
(useitems toggles the active-barrel mask +0x14 bits 2/4), GetBetterWeapon@0x80f40 (g_iWeaponPriority).
NEXT TASK = migrate CTSGun arsenal from the compact m_arsenalType[] list to items[]-by-tsweapon_t so a
single can be wielded/dropped independently of its akimbo pair. See HANDOFF.md "⭐ NEXT TASK".

## 2026-06-23 (cont. 69n) — death=spectate, spectator-chrome suppression, weapon-select rebuild

Playtest fixes (all RE-grounded + in-engine/user-confirmed):
- **Death re-enters spectate** (not timer-respawn): PlayerDeathThink, once the death anim finishes,
  routes to TSEnterSpectate (free-look + buy menu); respawn on FIRE after the gate. Verified via `kill`.
- **Spectator chrome suppressed in the TS phase**: the top-left green-grid overlay = the stock
  CHudSpectator overview/inset (DrawOverview, gated off in HUD_DrawNormalTriangles while
  m_Spectate.IsActive()); "Press DUCK for Spectator Menu" (#Spec_Duck, SpectatorPanel::ShowMenu)
  suppressed. The dark bottom bar = the stock SpectatorPanel bottom border geometry (height
  YRES_HD(PANEL_HEIGHT=64), mode at YRES_HD(6)) drawn via pfnFillRGBABlend (pfnFillRGBA is additive →
  black was invisible); user-confirmed match.
- **Config-apply flicker fixed**: the buy menu opened every spectate tick (server resends each
  countdown second) → reopened after apply. Now opens once on entering spectate. Kung-fu (TSW_MELEE)
  given on every spawn (BuyArmament). Status panel hidden while dead/spectating.
- **Weapon select REBUILT** (the stock yellow CHudAmmo menu retired; TS bar is the select UI). RE'd
  from FUN_1004f500/FUN_1004f220/FUN_1004d2cf/FUN_1004e030 (reference/WEAPON_SELECT.md): slot1-5 +
  invnext/invprev open the bar + move a cursor; FIRE commits `weapon_<N>` (holster→deploy, plays
  weapons/switch.wav); closes on commit/cancel (NO timer). Bar ALWAYS draws but very transparent;
  selecting brightens it, cursor most opaque (3-level additive opacity, no box); cursor shows
  curclip/maxclip. Mouse-scroll SKIPS kung-fu (type 0) + a single whose akimbo is owned (still
  slot-reachable). +attack consumed on commit (m_iKeyBits, like CHudAmmo::Think).
- **Kung-fu = fists** (v_melee.mdl, no clip; was the MK23 placeholder). **Dropping an akimbo throws
  TWO base singles** (clip split, ±4; CBasePlayer::DropWeapon @0x84900, TSAkimboBase = reverse iAkimboType).
- OPEN (need the akimbo-as-2×-single ownership model, our model is akimbo-as-one-slot): "drop the
  single (while holding akimbo) leaves the other"; the per-side single ownership.
- Commits 269420b/2bac9c7/96d1e93/58991ef/2f769d9/504d62f/43880b9/a679c18.

## 2026-06-23 (cont. 69m) — buy-menu config flow, TSMessage notifications, spectate HUD polish

User playtest feedback round (all RE-grounded + screenshot/user-confirmed):
- **First-start random + config toggle** (FUN_10036670 = menu open): first open per map randomizes the
  loadout → "Use New Config"; later opens reload the last-applied config → "Use Last Config". Open() guards
  on already-open (the server resends the spectate msg each countdown tick). Apply() saves the last config.
- **TSMessage SVC notification** (cl_dll/ts_message.{cpp,h} = CHudTSMessage): RE'd the handler chain
  FUN_100499e0 → FUN_1004c0a0 (parse: byte R,G,B,flags,holdtime + string) → FUN_1004b520 (15-slot centred
  queue). Our server already sends TSMessage (ts_utils.cpp); this adds the client handler (fixes the "No pfn
  TSMessage" error). Centred just below screen centre (flags 0); 0,0,0 → light text; **fades out** as it
  expires (additive font dimmed over the last second). The buy "Using new/last config." notice + the
  spectate "Press fire to play" prompt go through it ("press fire" is now a one-shot fade on the
  countdown→READY transition, was a permanent orange overlay).
- **Spectate bottom bar**: the original's dark bar IS the stock SpectatorPanel bottom border — geometry
  matched (height YRES_HD(PANEL_HEIGHT=64), bottom-anchored, "Free-Look" mode at YRES_HD(6), help near the
  bottom). Drawn with **pfnFillRGBABlend** (pfnFillRGBA is additive → black was invisible). User-confirmed match.
- **Status panel** (CHudTSStatus) hidden while dead/spectating (gHUD.m_Spectate.IsActive()).
- Commits 47d91fd (config/notify/fixes) / 2f769d9 (bar geometry).
- **AUTO-AMMO max field** captured from the LIVE hl.exe (PID via /proc/<pid>/mem, client.dll base
  0x0c070000, caliber table @0x0c10ffc0) — the static-0 max field [3]; see cont.69l + reference/MENUS.md.

## 2026-06-23 (cont. 69l) — REAL cascade buy menu REBUILT as a HUD element + verified vs user refs

Rebuilt the real cascade buy menu (the `0x10037xxx` cluster RE'd in 69k) as **`CHudTSBuyMenu : CHudBase`**
(`cl_dll/ts_buymenu.{cpp,h}`), replacing + **deleting** the legacy vgui `vgui_TSBuyMenu.*`. Wired into
hud.{h,cpp}/CMakeLists; input via HUD_Key_Event (keys) + IN_MouseEvent (mouse); opened by the `buy` cmd +
the spectate-wait Spectator msg; cursor freed via UpdateCursorState.

**Completed the RE first (reference/MENUS.md "★★ THE REAL BUY MENU"):** the obj field map (obj=HUDobj+0x7c0),
the full input state machine **FUN_10038840** (levels 0-8: config/category/weapons/detail/accessory/remove/
save/load/changeteam), the **mouse** path **FUN_10038360** (left=entry/miss=key1/right=key10) + hit-test
**FUN_10038410** (col=(mx-8)/0x80, row=(my-ScreenH/2)/0x14), accounting (budget 30000, slot cap 81, costs
FUN_10012ad0/FUN_10038dc0), apply **FUN_10039400** (rst_cfg + batched tkw/tki/tka), and the full weapon
cost table (price/slot/fullcnt extracted from the 36 init funcs; support/akimbo from the attach RE; hudCol/
sprite from the weapon-bar). Builders FUN_10037540/100377d0/10037960/10037ba0 + header/preview FUN_10036af0.

**Drawn faithfully + screenshot-verified** vs the user's 5 reference images: real roster (Beretta 92F #5,
Contender G2 #10 in Handguns; "Special Purpose"; "Go Back"), green "7 Random", blue Cancel, per-entry
availability colours, the **1-5 loadout-preview columns** (bought items by HUD column in add-order, count-
left-of-icon — Seal Knife 10 / Combat Knife 5 — Kevlar interleaved, `(Sil ,Las ,Fla ,Sco )` line),
**`Free Slots = 81 - used`** (remaining, not used), Total = weapon+attach (×fullcnt for full-load). All
match (Total 6300 = 500+1000+2900+1900; Free Slots 46 = 81-35). **Mouse confirmed working by the user.**
Save/load configs, Remove-Item, Change-Team, Random, Reset all implemented per the state machine.

**Auto-ammo DONE (runtime-captured).** The menu auto-fills each weapon's caliber to max, adds the cost to
Total, shows rounds left of the preview icon (Glock 210 / M16 120), emits `tka <cal>_<units>`. The per-caliber
**max** field reads 0 statically (set only at load), so the caliber table `DAT_1009ffc0` + per-weapon caliber
(`weapon_info+0x08`) were read from the LIVE hl.exe via `/proc/<pid>/mem` (client.dll base 0x0c070000, table
@0x0c10ffc0) — full table in reference/MENUS.md "AUTO-AMMO". Verified Glock → 350cr → Total 3400.

**Spectate HUD fixed.** RE-verified TS has NO stock spectator chrome (no top "Map:" bar) — inherited HL/TFC
`SpectatorPanel` was bleeding through. `SpectatorPanel::Update()` suppresses the top+bottom borders + Map/
timer/scores during TS spectate; `CHudSpectate::Draw()` draws the dark bottom bar + "Free-Look" + control help
in the HUD layer (was hidden under the vgui overlay). Screenshot-verified vs the original. Commits 258a447
(menu) / f17a453 (ammo) / 2bac9c7 (spectate).

## 2026-06-23 (cont. 69k) — DISCOVERY: we RE'd the WRONG (legacy) buy menu; full RE of the REAL one

User supplied reference screenshots of the real cascade buy menu (Config|Categories|Weapons|Detail columns
all visible, "Special Purpose", "Go Back", attachment costs, Beretta 92F + Contender G2 in Handguns). NONE of
that matched my menu RE. Root cause: the TS client.dll has TWO buy-menu code paths — the **legacy/dead** one
I RE'd + built (`0x10010xxx`, vgui::Panel, literal strings, `DAT_1007a950` table) and the **REAL** one the
game actually draws (`0x10037xxx`). All on-disk client.dll copies (incl. the Steam install) are byte-identical
(688128b) — same binary, I just RE'd the wrong builder. **User chose: RE + rebuild the real cascade menu.**

**Full RE of the real menu (cont.69k, all in reference/MENUS.md "★ THE REAL BUY MENU"):**
- It's **HUD-drawn, NOT vgui**: entries via `FUN_1004ff10` → `FUN_10021ce0`(=`TSHud_DrawString`) + the TS HUD
  font `DAT_100d5908` + `titles.txt` token localization (`FUN_100349a0`). So it reuses our existing HUD draw.
- **Cascade**: orchestrator `FUN_10036750` (switch on `obj+4` = level: 0 config/1 category/2 weapons/3 detail/
  4-7 accessory&c/8 off). Columns side-by-side at X=8/0x88/0x108/0x188, rowH 0x14, width 0x80. `FUN_10036af0`
  draws the top header (Total + Free Slots). Builders: config `FUN_10037540`, category `FUN_100377d0`,
  weapons `FUN_10037960`, detail `FUN_10037ba0`.
- **Colours**: available = half hud_r/g/b (dim); over-budget = red (195,45,45); Random/affordable-Buy = green
  (45,195,45); Cancel/GoBack = blue (100,100,205). "7 Random" is green BY DESIGN (not hover).
- **Real weapon roster** (the menu's own table `obj+0x2d6c`, indexed row*5+cat, filled by `FUN_10036200` — NOT
  DAT_1007a950): Handguns [1,9,12,14,2,21,22,28,31,36] (Beretta 92F #5, Contender G2 #10 — matches the image!),
  SMGs [3,6,7,17,19,23], Rifles [5,13,15,27,18], Shotguns [4,11,20,26,33], Special Purpose [24,25,32,34,35].
- **Attachment costs** (detail, "%i <name> %i" = key+cost): Silencer 900, Lasersight 800, Flashlight 500,
  Scope 1800. Availability via `FUN_10038d70` (same 0xE0/0xE4 weapon masks).

**NEXT: rebuild as a CHudBase HUD element** (header + cascade columns via TSHud_DrawString + TS font + the
roster/tokens/colours above), replacing the vgui CTSBuyMenuPanel. Still to RE: the input/level-advance handler,
the accessory column (states 4-7), the `FUN_10038180` weapon-preview geometry. The legacy vgui menu + its
cont.69g-j work is superseded for structure (the styling/colour findings carry over).

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 69i) — per-weapon attachment submenu RE'd + built + verified

User: clicking a weapon should open a per-weapon submenu to buy attachments; RE it. Done.

**RE (client.dll):** the 4th panel `+0x2d90` is built by **`FUN_10010bd0`** (state +0xc=4). It reads the
weapon (+0x28) + selected-attachment mask (+0x24) and builds: "1 Buy" (action 8), each available
attachment "Silencer/Lasersight/Flashlight/Scope" (action 10 = toggle bit, shown if `support & ~exclude &
~selected`), then "6 Buy Akimbo" (action 8) if akimbo OR "6 Full Load" (action 9), then "0 Cancel".
**The attachment availability is WEAPON DATA** (and the same data drives the HUD attached-icon row, per the
user): weapon-struct fields `0xE0` support mask / `0xE4` exclude mask (bit0 Sil,1 Las,2 Fla,3 Sco) / `0xC8`
akimbo type / `0xDC` full-load flag. Extracted the effective mask + akimbo + full for all 36 weapons from
their init funcs (e.g. MP5SD/AUG/Barrett/Ruger *exclude* their integrated silencer/scope). Full table in
reference/MENUS.md "Per-weapon attachment submenu — RESOLVED".

**Built (cl_dll/vgui_TSBuyMenu, `PAGE_WEAPON_DETAIL`):** clicking a weapon now opens the attachment submenu
(built from a new `s_weaponAttach[]` table); attachments toggle client-side (selected ones disappear);
Buy/Buy Akimbo/Full Load queue the weapon (`tkw <id>_1`, akimbo → variant id); Cancel → back to the list.
**In-engine verified** by mouse+key nav: detail renders Buy+attachments+Cancel, and MP5SD correctly shows
Lasersight/Flashlight/Scope (silencer excluded — RE-accurate). Both client arches build clean.
**DEFERRED (next slice):** the attachment-to-server wire encoding (the tangled `FUN_10012050` apply
string-builder) + server-side attachment application + the HUD attached-icon row — attachments are selected
client-side but not yet networked/applied.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 69h) — buy-menu interaction fixes (close/reopen/cursor/mouse-click)

User-reported bugs on the live menu, all fixed + in-engine verified:
- **Close:** config items 1/7/0 (Use New Config / Buy Random / Cancel — server TSMenuSelect cases 1/7/10)
  now hide the CLIENT panel via a new `CTSMenuHandler_SelectClose` (sends the menuselect cmd + `ShowTSBuyMenu(false)`).
  Before, they used `CMenuHandler_StringCommand(..., true)` → `HideTopMenu()`, which only closes the viewport's
  command menu, not our panel, so the menu persisted.
- **Reopen:** the client `buy` command (bound `b`) was forwarding to the server's now-no-op `TSSendBuyMenu`;
  it now reopens the client vgui panel directly (`gViewPort->ShowTSBuyMenu(true)`), gated on
  `gHUD.m_Spectate.IsActive()` (spectate-wait only). `cl_dll/ts_commands.cpp`.
- **Cursor:** `UpdateCursorState()` didn't include the buy menu, so the player stayed locked to aiming and
  couldn't click. Added `(m_pTSBuyMenu && m_pTSBuyMenu->IsUp())` to the "need cursor" condition.
- **Mouse-click on entries (the hard one):** clicks reached NOTHING in our panel (proven with a temp
  InputSignal that flips the box red on mousePressed — it never fired). TWO fixes: (1) the panel was a small
  child that lost vgui mouse-focus → rebuilt as a **full-screen panel** (0,0,ScreenWidth,ScreenHeight) with
  the box (a child `m_pBg`, resized per page) + entries at the menu origin inside it — the class/team-menu
  pattern; (2) it was created 2nd in `Initialize()`, BEHIND the later full-screen SpectatorPanel/ScoreBoard
  in z-order, which captured the mouse → moved `CreateTSBuyMenu()` to **LAST** so it's the topmost sibling.
  After the reorder the diagnostic box turned red (clicks reach the panel); removed the diagnostic.
  **Screenshot-verified:** clicking "2 Buy" → category page; clicking a category → its weapon list; the
  bound number keys still work too. Both client arches build clean.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 69g) — per-category weapon lists RE'd + built + in-engine verified

Closed the buy menu's remaining static-RE slice: the per-category weapon lists (Handguns/SMGs/Rifles/
Shotguns/Other). **All RE in reference/MENUS.md "Per-category weapon lists — RESOLVED".**

**RE (client.dll, via the persistent Ghidra client project):**
- The 3 "unmapped" action thunks resolved: `FUN_10010890`/`FUN_10010bb0` are just panel-hide stubs; the
  real builder is **ONE** function **`FUN_100108b0`**, parameterised by category at `clientobj+0x20`,
  rebuilding the `+0x2d8c` weapon-list panel. It iterates a `[cat][9]` weapon-id table **`DAT_1007a950`**,
  drops -1/restricted/(M61=id24 in non-team mode, `DAT_100cf97c>1` gate), labels `"%i %s"` green/red by
  affordability, ends with `0 Cancel` (100,100,205). Dumped the exact table from the PE:
  Handguns[1,9,12,14,8,21,22,28,31] SMGs[3,6,7,17,19,23] Rifles[5,13,15,27,18] Shotguns[4,11,20,26,33]
  Other[24,32,34,25,35].
- **Display names** = weapon struct `+0x44` (client table `DAT_100aa050`, stride `0xf7*4=0x3DC`,
  `FUN_100071c0`). Decompiled all 36 per-weapon init funcs (dispatcher `FUN_10007de0`) + resolved the
  `+0x44` source string for each → full id→name map (e.g. 3=Mini-Uzi, 19=MP7-PDW, 32=M60E3, 5=M4A1,
  27=M16A4, 15=STEYR-AUG, 25=Combat Knife, 35=Seal Knife — several differ from our server pszName).
- Confirmed via objdump that the entry label is `sprintf("%i %s", onscreenIdx+1, name)` and the entry-add
  is `FUN_100668f0(panel, idx, label, r,g,b, 0x32, scale, action=8)`; the availability green/Cancel-blue
  colours match the prior FUN_10011160 RE.

**Built + in-engine verified (cl_dll/vgui_TSBuyMenu.{h,cpp}):** a dynamic `PAGE_WEAPONS` rebuilt by
`ShowCategory(cat)` from the RE'd table (+ the M61 team-gate via `gViewPort->GetNumberOfTeams()>1`); the 5
buy-category buttons navigate to it; each weapon click emits the real **`tkw <id>_1`** (queues into the
server armament; commits on "Use New Config"→spawn `BuyArmament`); `0 Cancel` → back to category.
Reusable 10-slot page with one persistent per-slot action reading the live `m_weaponId[]` (categories swap
in place). **Screenshot-verified on tm_avana**: Handguns shows all 9 (Glock-18…Raging Bull) + blue Cancel,
SMGs shows the 6, single green numbers (the SDK CommandButton draws the bound-key column, so labels are the
bare name — matching the config/category pages). Fixed: panel `tall` 8→10 rows + per-page `setSize` so the
bg box hugs the active page (Handguns is 10 rows; was clipping rows 9-10). Both client arches build clean.

**STILL UNFINISHED:** (1) the per-weapon **detail submenu** (`6 Full Load`/`6 Buy Akimbo`, panel `+0x2d90`,
action 8's real target) + the faithful client-side **loadout queue + apply sequencer** (FUN_10012050 emits
rst_cfg+the tkw/tki/tka list at once — we bridge per-click); (2) the client **free-slots** red/unavailable
gate (`+0x430` vs 81); (3) the config-panel EXACT colours/positions (the runtime hbreak capture — still
needs the user's clean Proton relaunch; procedure in MENUS.md "Runtime capture").

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 69f) — buy-menu vgui reproduction (4 of 5 pages) + runtime-debug findings

Built the client-side buy menu as a faithful vgui reproduction (cl_dll/vgui_TSBuyMenu.{cpp,h} =
`CTSBuyMenuPanel`, owned by the viewport, shown in spectate-wait), and dug into the live original to crack
the config-panel exact styling that static RE couldn't reach. **All RE in reference/MENUS.md.**

**Built + committed (compile + render in-engine):**
- 3 menu PAGES as toggled vgui button sets with client-side page nav (`CTSMenuHandler_Page`): **Config**
  (8 items → server `menuselect`), **Buy-category** (RE'd FUN_10010440: Handguns/SMGs/Rifles/Shotguns/Other/
  Player Accessory/Cancel), **Player Accessory** (RE'd @0x10010dd0: Kevlar/Silencer/Lasersight/Flashlight/
  Scope; Kevlar→`cl_buykevlar`, ties to the kevlar gameplay). `CTSMenuButton` = CommandButton w/ the TFC
  orange suppressed (RE: plain vgui::Button look). Retired the server gmsgShowMenu stand-in.
- **Number-key routing** (HUD_Key_Event → `CTSBuyMenuPanel::HandleKey`: fires the visible page's button whose
  `getBoundKey()` matches; both click AND key now work, matching the original).

**Runtime-debug findings (the original TS runs live under Proton — gold for the remaining unknowns):**
- gdb attaches to the live game (`hl.exe -game ts`, find/x memory reads work; client.dll base **0x0c070000**,
  runtime = static − 0x3F90000). **SOFTWARE breakpoints (int3) silently DON'T fire** in this Proton/wow64
  process; **HARDWARE breakpoints (`hbreak`) DO** (proven: hbreak on HUD_Redraw @0x0c08aa90 fired). Verified
  FUN_100668f0 @0x0c0d68f0 byte-for-byte.
- **KEY: the vgui menu is built ONCE at first client init and fully CACHED for the process lifetime** —
  surviving map loads, reconnects, AND vid_restart/res-change (res-change only `setPos`-repositions the
  cached buttons; it does NOT recreate them, so the create-breakpoint FUN_100668f0 never re-fires). So the
  ONLY way to capture the build args (real per-button text+RGB+pos) is: arm the hbreak BEFORE the very first
  build → fully quit+relaunch the game, connect, then open the buy menu the first time with the hbreak
  already armed. Procedure is in MENUS.md ("Runtime capture — the exact procedure"). NOT YET EXECUTED (the
  user hit SDL-init errors relaunching — leftover wineserver/hl state from the attach/detach churn).
- **Weapon-list builders identified** (MENUS.md action-thunk map): `FUN_10010890` / `FUN_100108b0` /
  `FUN_10010bb0` (the unmapped action-`0xb` thunk targets) — decompile these for the per-category weapon lists.

**STILL UNFINISHED:** (1) per-category weapon LISTS (build the 5 lists from FUN_10010890/etc. + the weapon
table category field); (2) the config-panel EXACT colours/positions (the runtime hbreak capture — needs a
clean relaunch); the static-RE'd values applied so far are dims 128×20, config text white (placeholder),
category Cancel (100,100,205). Kevlar gameplay + status panel + HEV suppression + powerup/cashala = DONE.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 69d/e) — buy-menu mechanism FULLY RE'd + reproduction begun (vgui)

User corrected my earlier guesses (top-level kevlar; "it's VGUI"; improvised draw/input) and set the
goal: RE everything, one at a time, until the buy menu is faithfully reproduced exactly like the original
(behaviour/interface on the newer SDK, not internal offsets). Did the full RE; reverted the improvised
cl_dll menu; began the faithful vgui reproduction. **All findings in `reference/MENUS.md`.**

**Mechanism RE (client.dll):**
- **It IS a custom `vgui::Panel`** (NOT the MOTD `gmsgVGUIMenu`, and NOT the stock `gmsgShowMenu`).
  `FUN_10010440` builds the buy-category panel via `vgui::Panel::Panel`; each entry is a `vgui::Button`
  (`FUN_100668f0`→`operator_new(0x14c)`→`FUN_10066b40`). Four panels on the client obj: `+0x2d84` config,
  `+0x2d88` buy-category, `+0x2d8c`, `+0x2d90`; shown/hidden via vtable+0x24 = setVisible.
- **Open/close** = `FUN_10011230(visible)`: copies saved→active config (`+0x434`→`+0x2c`), rebuilds
  (`FUN_10011160` item 1 = Use New/Last/Empty Config by state; `FUN_100129f0` = loadout cost/"Total"),
  setVisible the panels.
- **Entry model**: `FUN_10066a90(panel,idx,text,x,y,…,actionId,actionVal)` → text@entry+0x104, geometry
  via `FUN_10066bb0` (x@0xf4,y@0xf8,…), action@+0x144/+0x148. String table @`0x10092808` (config order:
  Empty/Use-New/Use-Last Config, 2 Buy, 3 Remove Item, 4 Reset, 5 Save, 6 Load, 7 Buy Random, 0 Cancel;
  buy-category @0x10092824: 1 Handguns,2 SMGs,3 Rifles,4 Shotguns,5 Other, +6 Player Accessory @0x10092848).
- **Hierarchy**: Config → 2 Buy → categories → 6 Player Accessory → Kevlar/Lasersight/Silencer
  (`cl_buykevlar`/`cl_laser`/`cl_lasercolor`; accessory selected-bit 0x10). Select by mouse-click OR bound
  number key; click-outside ⇒ "Use New Config".
- **Client buy-validation** `FUN_100124a0`: gates a buy on cash (CashBased off) + the **free-slots** resource
  `this+0x430` vs cap `0x51`(81) — the "Free Slots" HUD value + `GetSpeedBySlots` speed input.
- **Apply** `FUN_10012050` ("Use New Config"): validate (empty/cash/slots) → sort loadout → `ServerCmd`:
  `rst_cfg`, then per-item `tkw %i_%i`/`tka %i_%i`/`tki` (+ `weapon_%i`/`lasclr_%i`). = the existing server
  `ClientCommand` handlers (`reference/BUY.md`). Remaining tie-off: the exact kevlar item-queue token in the
  accessory branch.

**Reproduction (vgui, modelled on `cl_dll/vgui_teammenu.cpp`):**
- **Slice 1 DONE (committed):** `cl_dll/vgui_TSBuyMenu.{h,cpp}` = `CTSBuyMenuPanel` — the CONFIG menu as a
  `vgui::Panel` of `CommandButton`s with `setBoundKey(number)` + `CMenuHandler_StringCommand` → the server
  `menuselect` handler. Correct RE-grounded architecture (not the reverted hand-drawn HUD).
- **Slice 2 + 2c DONE (committed, IN-ENGINE VERIFIED):** owned in `TeamFortressViewport` (`CreateTSBuyMenu`),
  `ShowTSBuyMenu(show)` + `UpdateCursorState`, triggered from `CHudSpectate::MsgFunc_Spectator` (show in
  spectate-wait, hide on spawn). Retired the server `gmsgShowMenu` stand-in (`TSSendBuyMenu` no-op). **Verified
  by screenshot:** the vgui config menu (1 Use New Config … 7 Buy Random) draws during spectate-wait with the
  panel background; the old server text menu is gone; pressing bound key `1` fires `menuselect 1` + closes the
  menu. (The buttons reuse the server `TSMenuSelect` for config actions — a faithful bridge for the top level.)
- **Slice 3 DONE (committed) — buy-category submenu page.** RE'd from `FUN_10010440`: the category page
  (Handguns/SMGs/Rifles/Shotguns/Other + Player Accessory + `0 Cancel` at colour `(100,100,205)`) built as
  a toggled button page in `CTSBuyMenuPanel` with a `CTSMenuHandler_Page` action (config↔category nav).
  Compiles + renders. **KNOWN GAPS:** (a) the viewport routes number keys only to its *current command
  menu*, not this panel, so key-nav to the category page isn't wired (mouse-click on the vgui buttons is
  the path; cursor-state/UpdateCursorState needs confirming); (b) the per-category **weapon lists** + the
  **accessory** page (their builders decompile — next RE slice); (c) the config-panel exact colours/positions.
- **CONFIG-PANEL WALL — runtime inspect needed but NOT executable here.** The `+0x2d84` config panel is
  provably not statically RE-able (0 writes/allocs/sizers in 157K-line disasm; Ghidra mis-decompiles the
  region). The runtime-inspect path (run the ORIGINAL TS `client.dll` under wine+winedbg, break at the menu
  show, read the live `+0x2d84` panel's child positions/colours) is **blocked: no runnable original TS on
  this box** (no hl.exe / game install; `~/Projects/the-specialists` is stock-SDK source, not the menu code).
  Needs a HL+TS Windows install under wine first. Static-RE'd values applied so far: dimensions 128×20, the
  per-entry RGB colour *system*, the navigation; config items drawn white pending the inspect.
- **Slice 2d DONE (committed, VERIFIED) — RE-grounded styling.** First styled it wrong (used the SDK
  CommandButton's TFC orange box skin). RE'd the real draw: TS entries are plain `vgui::Button`
  (`FUN_10066b40` vtable = all imported vgui::Button methods, no paint override); colours set per-entry by
  `FUN_10011160` — **available = green (45,195,45), unavailable = red (195,45,45)** (button+0xfc/0x100). The
  orange was only `CommandButton::paintBackground` (boxes) + `paint()` forcing `Scheme::sc_primary1`.
  `CTSMenuButton` keeps CommandButton's bound-key/action but overrides `paint()` → TS green/red via
  `vgui::Button::paint`, `paintBackground()` → empty. Verified: green text on the faint panel, no orange.
- **NEXT slices (specified, not built):** (3) the **Buy** (`menuselect 2`) → weapon-category submenu + the
  **Player Accessory** submenu (Kevlar/Lasersight/Silencer via `cl_buykevlar`/`cl_laser`) — these are
  client-side nav panels (the 2nd/3rd of the 4 RE'd panels); the **per-category weapon lists** come from the
  category builders (still to decompile). (4) the client-side loadout-build + **apply** sequencer
  (rst_cfg/tkw/tki/tka, `FUN_10012050`) + the kevlar item-queue token. Mouse-click selection + cursor visibility
  to confirm in spectate. Build each as a compiled+verified increment.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 69c) — kevlar GAMEPLAY reconstructed + buy-menu layout RE'd (two user corrections)

Continuing from the status-panel work, the user asked to reconstruct the real kevlar gameplay (not the
item_battery test crutch). RE'd from `ts_i386.so` and implemented; then the user caught two of my errors
and made me RE properly.

**Kevlar gameplay (committed):**
- `CBasePlayer::TakeArmor(int)` @0x83da4 — kevlar is a **binary flag** (`m_bHasKevlar`, orig player+0x718
  bit 0x10) + a 100 `armorvalue` marker; grant/remove + `weapons/items.wav`. SLICE: the orig also
  costs/refunds 10 **"free slots"** (player+0x548 — the HUD "Free Slots") and recomputes move speed via
  `GetSpeedBySlots`(@0x66bd4, `speed=210+freeslots*factor`)/`SetPlayerSpeed`(@0x83068, clamp 0..330 +
  pfnSetClientMaxspeed). That free-slots **encumbrance subsystem** is deferred (every item costs slots;
  the speed factors are runtime-init .data = 0.0 in file, statically unrecoverable).
- `CBasePlayer::TakeDamage` @0x7fa94 — armor is a **flat `armor_absorb` % damage REDUCTION, NOT a
  depleting pool**. Replaced the inherited HL depleting-armor block: if `armorvalue!=0` and dmgtype not in
  the **0x80040e4 bypass mask** (melee slash/club + fall + blast + radiation + no-armor bit → kevlar stops
  BULLETS only), `flDamage *= (1 - armor_absorb)`. New `CTSGameRules::m_flArmorAbsorb` (config-driven,
  default 0.5 — the orig parses `armor_absorb %f` from a server config into gamerules+0x588c; not a cvar).
- `CBasePlayer::AddItem(int)` @0x8440c — loadout item-grant (kevlar bit 0x10 → TakeArmor(100); grenade
  0x20 → team M61). `BuyArmament` @0x83f10 now routes item entries (the armament's 3rd field, renamed
  `gift`→`isItem`) → AddItem, weapons → BuyWeapon. Kevlar resets per-life in Spawn.
- Verified in xash: HUD shows "Kevlar" after granting via the loadout path (AddItem→TakeArmor→TSArmor→panel).
  Damage reduction verified by construction (faithful formula). Build clean, no coverage regressions.

**USER CORRECTION #1 — kevlar menu placement was INVENTED.** I'd added a top-level "Buy Kevlar" entry to
the (stand-in) buy menu by guessing — violating RE-before-code. RE'd the real menu (client.dll .data +
builders) → `reference/MENUS.md`. **USER CORRECTION #2 — it's NOT VGUI.** The buy menu is a **client-side
custom-drawn TEXT menu** (builders call `FUN_10066a90(panel,idx,text,x,y,…,scale)` positioned-text draw;
`FUN_10011160` = config-menu item 1), NOT `gmsgVGUIMenu` (the MOTD-style panel) and NOT the stock
`gmsgShowMenu`/`CHudMenu`. Hierarchy: **Config menu** (1 Use New/Last/Empty Config · 2 Buy · 3 Remove Item ·
4 Reset Config · 5 Save Config · 6 Load Config · 7 Buy Random · 0 Cancel) → **2 Buy** → categories (1 Handguns
· 2 SMGs · 3 Rifles · 4 Shotguns · 5 Other · 6 Player Accessory) → **6 Player Accessory** → **Kevlar** (toggle,
`cl_buykevlar`, accessory flag bit 0x10) / Lasersight / Silencer. So kevlar = **Buy → Player Accessory →
Kevlar**, never top-level. Reverted the invented entry + handler; fixed "7 Random"→"7 Buy Random".

**NEXT:** the faithful client buy-menu system (custom text-menu draw via FUN_10066a90 + per-category weapon
lists + each entry's send-action) is a Track B (cl_dll) reconstruction — the kevlar gameplay is ready, the
faithful UI to select it is deferred. Plus the free-slots encumbrance + speed penalty subsystem.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 69b) — faithful TS status panel (posture figure + health-heart + Kevlar)

User feedback while verifying `powerup 3`: the "150" I screenshotted was the **stock HEV** health number,
NOT TS's custom HUD. TS replaces the stock health/battery entirely with a bottom-left **status panel**:
team name on top, a **posture figure** sprite, the **health number + a heart**, and a binary **"Kevlar"**
indicator (armor is kevlar-or-not, never a number — our old `CHudTSStatus` drew "Armor: N", wrong). The
figure reflects stance: standing / crouched / **prone** (prone via CTSStunt — +alt1 dive, double-jump
roll-to-prone, direction-dependent; e.g. double-jump-backward does NOT prone).

**RE (client.dll):** sprite-load block @0x10049d1f loads `sprites/player/{stand,crouched,prone,health,
kevlar,kungfu,movement,flag}.spr` (+ directional `divestep{b,c,t}.spr`) into slots stand=0x38 crouched=0x3c
prone=0x40 health=0x58 kevlar=0x5c. `"%i Kevlar  %i"` draw @0x1003808e. ("Free Slots : %i" @0x100929f8 is
the weapon/buy bar FUN_10011a60, a separate element — not this panel.)

**Reconstruction (`cl_dll/ts_status.{cpp,h}`):** rewrote VidInit (SPR_Load the 5 panel sprites + rects) and
Draw — team name (g_PlayerExtraInfo), posture figure (crouch via local player `curstate.usehull==1`; prone
via a new `g_iTSProne` extern hook, dormant until CTSStunt sets it), health + heart sprite, Kevlar drawn only
when `m_iArmor>0` (sprite if present, else "Kevlar" text). Missing sprites fall back to text (never crash).

**Verified in xash (screenshots vs the user's reference):** standing figure → 100 + heart; ducking → swaps to
`crouched.spr`; with real armor (sv_cheats 1; give item_suit; give item_battery) → the **"Kevlar"** label
appears below the health. Matches the reference. Scope chosen by the user ("Status panel HUD now") = stand/
crouch live, prone deferred to CTSStunt.

**Gotchas this session:** (1) TSHealth/TSArmor are sent server-side **on change only** — right after spawn the
panel shows 0 until the player fully enters play (settles to 100 a beat later; not a bug). (2) `give` needs
`sv_cheats 1`; **TS players lack the HEV suit**, so `item_battery` alone adds no armor — `give item_suit`
first (and TS's `sk_battery` may be 0). `item_battery` was only a TEST CRUTCH to force armorvalue>0; it is NOT
how TS grants kevlar.

**Stock-HEV suppression (cont.69b, committed):** user noted the stock HEV health number was still drawing over
the TS panel. The original `.so` registers **NO stock Health/Battery user messages** (only TSHealth/TSArmor —
no "Health"/"Battery" strings exist in ts_i386.so), so TS has no stock health HUD. Our inherited server still
sent gmsgHealth/gmsgBattery → the stock CHudHealth number/cross + CHudBattery drew. Fix: suppressed the stock
health-number block (`cl_dll/health.cpp`, `if(false && HasSuit())`) and the stock battery draw (`battery.cpp`,
early `return true`), keeping CHudHealth's directional damage feedback. Verified: bottom-left shows only the
TS panel. NB CHudHealth::Draw does NOT gate on HUD_ACTIVE (draws on HasSuit), so server-side message-suppression
alone wouldn't have stopped it — client suppression was required.

**KEVLAR mechanic RE'd (cont.69b — answering the user's Qs; NOT yet implemented server-side):**
- `CBasePlayer::TakeArmor(int)` @0x83da4: kevlar is a **bought binary flag** (bit 0x10 in player+0x718).
  Buying (arg>=0, flag clear): require cash(player+0x548)>=10, **deduct 10 cash**, set flag, play
  `weapons/items.wav`, then armorvalue = min(arg+armorvalue, cap). Selling (arg<0): refund 10 cash, clear flag,
  armorvalue=0. Also calls `GetSpeedBySlots`+`SetPlayerSpeed` → **kevlar imposes a move-speed penalty**.
- `CBasePlayer::TakeDamage` @0x7fa94: armor is **flat % damage PROTECTION, not a depleting pool**. If
  `armorvalue!=0` AND damage-type not in bypass mask 0x80040e4 AND valid player state:
  `damage -= armor_absorb * damage` (i.e. `damage *= (1 - armor_absorb)`), where `armor_absorb` =
  g_pGameRules+0x588c (cvar `armor_absorb`, clamped <=1.0). armorvalue is NOT decremented by hits. So the HUD
  showing kevlar BINARY ("Kevlar"/nothing) is correct. There's also `player/kevlarhit.wav` + "with kevlar"/
  "no kevlar" strings. **OPEN server work:** reconstruct TakeArmor + the TakeDamage armor_absorb block + the
  kevlar buy (cl_buykevlar → 10 cash) + the speed penalty (none implemented yet; our TakeDamage still inherits
  HL's depleting-armor model). Then the panel's kevlar reflects real gameplay.

NEXT for this area: the kevlar server mechanic above, wire kevlar into the buy/loadout, and the prone posture
once CTSStunt lands.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 69) — `powerup` + `cashala` cheat commands wired (server cmds 2 missing → 0)

Closed the last two MISSING server console commands in the coverage harness — both turned out to be
**cheat/debug commands**, RE'd from `ts_i386.so` `ClientCommand` (objdump + GOT 0x165E10 resolution;
the harness's GOT-relative `lea→strcmp` reproduction enumerated the full dispatch).

**`cashala` (@0x9dd5d):** NOT the buy config-apply that `reference/BUY.md` (cont.68h) hypothesized — it's
a **cheat**: a float guard `flds 0.0 ; fcomps *g_flWeaponCheat` (the engine `sv_cheats` mirror, GOT
0x1dbc → `g_flWeaponCheat` @0x18f268) gates `GiveCash(player, 0x7530=30000)`. The `weapon_`/`%i` strstr+
sscanf right after it (@0x9dd98) is just the numeric `weapon_<N>` select transport (already handled).
Wired: `cashala` → `if (g_psv_cheats->value) player->GiveCash(30000)` (dlls/client.cpp). BUY.md corrected.

**`powerup <N>` (@0x9dafd):** the debug cheat that grants a powerup directly (the string is the `ts_powerup`
suffix @0xf76da, distinct from `usepowerup`). Gates: `Cmd_Argc()>1`, `CBasePlayer::IsAlive()` (vt+0xb4, via
VTABLES.md), a `pev+0x244` observer-state check (approximated by `!m_fInSpectateWait`). A jump table
(`-0xc8264(%ebx,%eax,4)`, base @0x9dbac) maps N→effect: **1→held SlowPause(8,5s), 5→held DblFire(0x10,5s),
default→held SlowMo(1,5s); 2→grenade weapon (PickUpWeapon tsweapon 24=M61), 3→health 150+regen, 4→MultiplyClips
(inf-clip) on the active CTSGun.** Held path guarded by `m_iPowerups==0` (orig 0x724 check) + same-type 5s
extend. Implemented `TSGrantPowerup(player, mask, dur)` in dlls/ts_powerup.cpp (mirrors PlayerAddPowerUp's
per-bit dispatch); client.cpp maps N→TS_PWUP_* and calls it.

**Verified:** `scripts/build.sh amd64 [client]` clean (glibc floor 2.14); `coverage.py all` → **server console
commands 2 missing → 0** (matched 18→20). **In-engine (xash3d-fwgs, listen server, screenshot):** spawned the
local player out of spectate-wait, `sv_cheats 1`; `cashala` → cash HUD **$30000**; `powerup 3` → health HUD
**150** — both accepted (no "Unknown command"). The original also fires a `PwUp` held-available HUD message on
the held path (deferred client work — still MISSING in user-messages). NEXT: the remaining coverage gaps are now
all client/HUD readers (PwUp/PwUpTime/TSState/TSSlowMo/Objective/ClipInfo/… — 25 MISSING user-messages) + the
TS events (coldcock/knife/katana/pump/grenade) + the 0%-method classes (CTSStunt/CTSSharedEmitter/CBulletManager).

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 68) — drop-in interface COVERAGE HARNESS + Ghidra tooling fixes

User asked for a coverage test proving our client+server are drop-in-compatible with the original on
the EXTERNAL contract (commands/cvars/messages/events/entities/exports — NOT internal C++ ABI, which
is explicitly out of scope per CLAUDE.md), to catch invented commands + HL leftovers + gaps and serve
as a RE roadmap. Also fix the recurring "Ghidra truncated" problem.

**Ghidra tooling (`scripts/ghidra/`):** `DisableNoReturn.java` (preScript — turns off the
"Non-Returning Functions - Discovered" analyzer that wrongly marks normal funcs noreturn and truncates
caller bodies at analysis time); `FixNoReturn.java` (postScript — clears stray noreturn flags except real
libc ones); `DecompAt.java` now auto-creates a function when Ghidra didn't define one (the cmd-handler
thunks) + clears noreturn on the target. `scripts/coverage/setup-ghidra.sh` rebuilds persistent projects
under `recovered/ghidra/{server,client}` (gitignored, survives reboot — /tmp is tmpfs here). NB the huge
`ClientCommand` still resists Ghidra flow analysis; the harness uses `objdump` for it (reliable).

**Coverage harness (`scripts/coverage/coverage.py`, pure objdump/nm/rz-bin — no Ghidra dep):** extracts
the interface manifest from original (ts_i386.so + client.dll + the original `ts/default.cfg`/`config.cfg`)
AND ours (hl.so + client.so + source), diffs → `reference/coverage/{original,ours}.json` + `REPORT.md`.
Categories DONE (matched/missing/extra): entity classes (FGD vs LINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS, 140/8/141 — missing =
ts_emitter/ts_particle/ts_wind/info_player_team1-4/info_player_coop), client cldll exports (40/2/…),
server console commands (ClientCommand strcmp via GOT-resolved PIC: 8/12/24 — missing firemode/useitems/
respawn/jointeam/changeteam/motd/powerup/rst_cfg/cashalarm/tkw/tki/tka; extra = our tsbuy*/tsfiremode/
dropweapon/tscutwire/tsspawnflag stand-ins + HL leftovers give/+break/etc.), client commands (58/1/8),
client cvars (binary `pfnRegisterVariable` @ds:0x100d5b60, name+default: 93/14/21 + default mismatches),
user messages (client `pfnHookUserMsg` @ds:0x100d5b70: 51/25/7 — missing = the deferred HUD readers
PwUpTime/TSState/TSSlowMo/Objective/ClipInfo/…; extra = HL leftovers Flashlight/Weapons), events
(string-scan: 4/8/19 — missing TS coldcock/knife/katana/pump/grenade; extra = stock-HL crossbow/egon/
gauss/… we still precache), + a default.cfg input cross-check (2 unanswered: firemode, useitems).

**KEY CORRECTIONS from user ground truth (config files / running the original):**
- `buy` IS real (default.cfg binds b→buy; the client.dll `buy` cmd string @0x10095b34) — my earlier
  "no buy command" was wrong (I'd matched only the "1 Buy"/"2 Buy" menu entries). cont.66's buy is faithful.
- cvars must come from the BINARY's pfnRegisterVariable sites, NOT config.cfg — config.cfg holds only the
  archived (written-out) subset, so it falsely flagged stock cvars like zoom_sensitivity_ratio as "extra".

**Vtable + relocation tooling (cont.68b — user asked for richer C/C++ recovery via vtables/SDK
types/demangling):** Discovered the original .so DOES carry `.stab`/`.stabstr` — but ONLY for gcc-2.96's
own runtime units (libgcc2/tinfo/new/exception), no mod-class type info. BUT: 226 `__vt_<class>` vtable
symbols + RTTI exist, and the vtable slots (zero in the file) are filled by **R_386_32 relocations against
named method symbols** — so `readelf -W -r` yields each vtable+offset → exact method. Built
`scripts/coverage/extract_vtables.py` → `reference/coverage/vtables_original.json` + `VTABLES.md`: the
COMPLETE slot→method layout for all 226 classes (machine-confirmed `CTSGun` vtable+0x128 = `CTSGun::Deploy()`,
matching the cont.67 manual find; +0x130 Holster, +0x124 CanDeploy, etc.). Use: resolve any decompiled
`call [vptr+0xNN]` to the real method, and cross-check our virtual-override set per class. KEY INSIGHT: the
same **relocation map** resolves ALL .data pointers (cvar_t name/string structs, REG_USER_MSG name pointers,
function tables) that are zero-in-file — this unlocks the deferred coverage gaps (server cvars + message
sizes) and is the basis for the next Ghidra type-application pass (apply entvars_t C-struct + demangled
gcc2 signatures + vtable annotation). NB STABS is NOT useful for mod member offsets — those stay analytic;
but `entvars_t`/engine structs are pure C (ABI-stable offsets) so they CAN be applied verbatim.

**Scoreboard "WAITING" status for spectators (cont.68l, VERIFIED):** RE'd the original scoreboard
(client.dll FUN_1005db70) — the "class" column is a switch on the player's playerclass; **case 0xb (11)
→ "WAITING"** (and default→WAITING when the connected-flag is set). Reconstructed: server sets
`pev->playerclass = 11` (TS_SCORE_WAITING) while spectate-waiting (TSEnterSpectate, cleared to 0 in
TSLeaveSpectate) and broadcasts a ScoreInfo (new `CBasePlayer::TSSendScoreInfo`), re-asserted each
TSSpectateThink tick (a connect-time class-0 ScoreInfo was overwriting the spectate send — the bug behind
the first blank test); the TS team ScoreInfo (ts_teams.cpp) now sends pev->playerclass too. Client
(vgui_ScorePanel.cpp COLUMN_CLASS): playerclass 11 → "WAITING" UNCONDITIONALLY (before the TFC team gate
that was hiding it for teamless spectators). **Verified by screenshot** (tm_avana, spectating): the row
shows name + "WAITING", matching the user's reference (DM + teamplay). Note: AssignToTeam already sets the
per-team LOCKED model (ts_teams.cpp:165), so jointeam's model assignment is in place (the cont.68k
model-lock fidelity item).

**`jointeam` + `changeteam` wired + model↔team RE (cont.68k):** RE'd both handlers (objdump + GOT
resolution): `changeteam` pushes `gmsgVGUIMenu` → opens the team-select VGUI menu; `jointeam` strtols a
team number + calls a g_pGameRules team-change. Wired: `changeteam` → send gmsgVGUIMenu(MENU_TEAM=2);
`jointeam <N>` → `AssignToTeam(player, GetIndexedTeamName(N))` + respawn. Server-command missing 4→2
(remaining: `powerup`, `cashala` — both need RE). **MODEL↔TEAM finding (user Q):** the model is LOCKED —
`CHalfLifeMultiplay::ClientUserInfoChanged` (which TS inherits, NOT CHalfLifeTeamplay) resets a changed
`model` infokey back to the player's stored model (player+0xb48) via pfnSetClientKeyValue + says "Can't
change team to '%s'"/"HLDM models not allowed" (unless defaultteam off + a vtable IsValid check passes).
So team rides the model but you can't pick it by model-swap; team changes go through jointeam/changeteam,
model is force-locked to the assigned team. FIDELITY TODO: confirm our inherited ClientUserInfoChanged
matches this lock; the per-team locked-model assignment in jointeam is a SLICE (we set pev->team, not yet
the team model).

**`respawn` + `motd` wired (cont.68j):** RE'd both ClientCommand handlers (objdump). `motd` →
`SendMOTDToClient(edict)` (the protected CHalfLifeMultiplay method) → exposed via a public
`CTSGameRules::ResendMOTD` passthrough, called from the `motd` dispatch via `TSGameRules()`.
`respawn` → the original shows TSHudMessageOne "You have to wait until the next round." (red 195,45,45)
and StopObserver-respawns when allowed; reconstructed as `CBasePlayer::TSTryRespawn` — leave the
cont.66 spectate-gate (`TSLeaveSpectate`) if `gpGlobals->time >= m_flSpawnGateTime`, else the wait
message. Server-command missing 6→4 (remaining: changeteam/jointeam = team-select menu, powerup, cashala
= buy-apply — all need RE); 0 unanswered binds held.

**`useitems` wired → default.cfg cross-check now 0 unanswered (cont.68i):** `CTSGun::SwitchItems` +
`TSSwitchItems` + the `useitems` dispatch (default.cfg binds g). RE: the original SwitchItems body
(FUN_0009155c) is register-garbled in the decompile, but the ClientCommand gate (weapon id 16) + the
akimbo flag check + re-deploy identify it as the akimbo dual-wield swap. SLICE: our akimbo is a single
combined slot, so SwitchItems toggles the active barrel side (m_akimboSide) + re-deploys, gated on
iFireType AKIMBO/AKIMBO_ONLY; the full left/right items[] split is not reconstructed. Server-command
missing 7→6 (remaining: changeteam/jointeam/motd/powerup/respawn/cashala — team-menu/respawn/buy-apply);
**every default.cfg-bound command is now answered by our client or server (0 unanswered).**

**Buy/loadout-config command protocol RE'd + stand-ins renamed (cont.68h, `reference/BUY.md`):**
Decompiled the buy block of ClientCommand. Real commands + arg formats: `rst_cfg`→ResetArmament;
`tkw` arg `"%i_%i"`(type_count)→AddItemToArmament; `tki` arg `"%i"`→AddItemToArmament single; `tka`
arg `"%i_%i"`(caliber_count)→AddAmmoToArmament; `cutwire_<n>`/`drop_<n>` prefix commands;
`cashala…`→GiveCash + apply a config string parsing `weapon_%i` + `lasclr_%i`(laser colour). The
faithful buy flow = QUEUE (tkw/tki/tka) → APPLY (cashala config), not a direct per-weapon buy.
Renamed our stand-ins: tsarm→`tkw`, tsarmammo→`tka`, tsresetarmament→`rst_cfg`, tscutwire→`cutwire_<n>`
(prefix), added `tki`; kept tsbuy/tsbuyammo/tsbuyarmament as dev stand-ins (no 1:1 original — the
apply is cashala; honest "extra" in coverage). Server-command coverage: missing 11→7, extra 22→18.
Remaining missing = changeteam/jointeam/motd/powerup/respawn/useitems/cashala (team-menu/respawn +
the cashala apply-name, need RE). Buy UI (the client emitting these) still deferred.

**Acted on the coverage findings — 3 fidelity fixes (cont.68g):**
- **Health wire size 2→1** (the cont.68f finding): `REG_USER_MSG("Health",1)` + both `WRITE_SHORT`→`WRITE_BYTE`
  (player.cpp) + client `READ_SHORT`→`READ_BYTE` (health.cpp). Our build was self-consistent at 2 but the
  original uses 1 (health is byte-capped); now matches → drop-in safe. Harness confirms 0 size mismatches.
- **CTSGroundAmmo magsN under-give**: ours gave `magcount` rounds; the original gives `magcount * roundsPerMag`.
  Recovered the per-caliber rounds-per-mag table (s_ammo_info+0x10, runtime-built in compile_ammo_info — read
  via parsing its assignments, NOT the file which is zero; all 13 calibers cross-validated against +0x20 vs
  our kAmmoMax): `[30,12,8,30,10,30,20,5,15,17,5,20,5]`. Added `TSRoundsPerMag()` + multiply in WaitTouch.
- **ts_fog**: already correct — its original Spawn is `UTIL_Remove(this)`, so near/far/color are dead in both
  (no fix; added to SELF_REMOVING_ENTITIES so the harness stops flagging it).
- **Keyvalue-harness false positives fixed**: it now understands all 3 handling styles — literal FStrEq,
  `strncmp` PREFIX loops (mags/message/objptarget), and `keys[N]={...}` arrays (objmsg*) — + skips
  self-removing entities. Entity keyvalue coverage now **0 unhandled** (was 4 false-flagged entities).

**User-message WIRE SIZES added + a real bug caught (cont.68f):** `coverage.py server_usermsg_sizes_orig`
parses `LinkUserMessages__Fv` via objdump (`push $size; lea name(%ebx); call *0x12c` = pfnRegUserMsg slot)
→ 64 message sizes (Health=1, Damage=12, SayText=-1, RoundTime=2, WeaponInfo=6, WStatus=3, …); diffed vs our
REG_USER_MSG literal sizes. **Caught a real wire mismatch: `Health` is size 1 in the original, 2 in ours**
(a silent protocol corrupter — drop-in breaker; fix = match the original). Also fixed `fn_range` to skip
same-address symbol aliases (gcc2_compiled. shares LinkUserMessages' addr → was an empty range).

**Keyvalue-gap RE (cont.68f, acting on the harness findings):** `CTSGroundAmmo::KeyValue` (@0x92718) parses
`mags<N>` (strncmp "mags" + strtol suffix) → `m_mags[N] = magcount * get_ammo_info(N).roundsPerMag(+0x10)`,
plus `wduration`→respawn(+0xa8); our CTSGroundAmmo ignores the map mags = a real TODO. **`CTSFog::Spawn` is
just `UTIL_Remove(this)`** — the original deletes ts_fog on spawn, so near/far/color are intentionally
ignored: the harness's ts_fog keyvalue "gap" is a NON-issue (match by removing it).

**Tooling assessment — #1/#2/#4 (diminishing returns, NOT built):** native in-decompiler vtable typing is
superseded in practice by `vtcall.py` (resolves dispatch offsets→methods) for a heavy Ghidra-API lift;
dedicated RTTI/`__ti` hierarchy is redundant with the vtable data (inherited slots already name their base
class) and the gcc2 __ti layout resists clean automated parsing; spawnflag coverage can list the FGD
bit→label inventory but can't be verified as handled (we use raw bits/SF_ names, not FGD labels) so it's not
a real coverage check. Higher-value next work = act on findings (Health size, ts_groundammo mags, sk_*/
stock-HL event/message leftover cleanup).

**Ghidra type recovery extended (cont.68e) — entvars_t fields + MSVC return types:**
`ApplyTypes.java` now also (a) parses engine/progdefs.h to populate `entvars_t` with REAL fields
(extracts just the plain `typedef struct{}` blocks + a 4-type prelude, since the modern progdefs.h
has C++ `constexpr` the Ghidra C-parser rejects) → 668-byte entvars_t, so a typed `entvars_s *` param
resolves static `pev->origin`-style accesses; and (b) merges RETURN types from the MSVC exports
(signatures-mp.txt + signatures-client.txt: `public: RET __thiscall Class::Method(...)`), which the
gcc2 demangle omits → 691 return types parsed, 164 applied (complete return+param prototypes on the
exported subset). Verified: entvars_t 668B, params typed entvars_s*. (Funcs using the runtime
gEntvarsDescription offset-table still show computed offsets — expected.) setup-ghidra.sh auto-applies.

**Coverage dimensions added (cont.68d) — entity keyvalues + method completeness:**
- **Entity keyvalue coverage** (`coverage.py`): per implemented FGD entity, which declared map keys NO
  `KeyValue()` handles (engine-auto keys = entvars_t fields + stock/compile-tool keys excluded). Surfaces 4
  real behavioral gaps: `ts_fog` ignores far/near, `ts_groundammo` ignores mags1..11, `ts_objective_manager`
  ignores messagea-d/objptargeta-h, `ts_objective_ptr` ignores objmsg*. = internal-state replication TODOs.
- **Method completeness** (`scripts/coverage/reconstruction.py` → `RECONSTRUCTION_COVERAGE.md`): per TS class,
  methods in the original (signatures-gcc2) vs implemented in our hl.so (nm|c++filt). **60 classes, 140/368
  methods (38%)**, least-complete first: CTSStunt 0/25, CTSSharedEmitter 0/11, CBulletManager 0/7, the
  particle/emitter/wind + per-category weapon-factory classes 0% (some intentional — CTSGun subsumes the leaf
  CTSPistolWeapon/etc.). A completeness ROADMAP (not an ABI match). Also renamed tsfiremode→firemode,
  dropweapon→drop (real names, default.cfg-confirmed); committed cont.67 weapon-switch + all tooling.

**Reconstruction tooling — the 3 improvements built + validated (cont.68c):**
- **#1 typed decompiles — `scripts/ghidra/ApplyTypes.java`** (postScript): applies the recovered gcc2
  signatures (`reference/signatures-gcc2.map`) as REAL Ghidra prototypes → 2570 functions typed; the `this`
  pointer + call args are typed (`Deploy__6CTSGun(CTSGun *this)` not `int param_1`). Conservative type model
  (named empty structs for classes — NO faked member layout, since gcc2 offsets differ from our Itanium SDK
  and there's no mod debug info; members still show as offsets). Auto-run by `setup-ghidra.sh` after import.
- **#2 virtual-dispatch resolution — `scripts/coverage/vtcall.py`**: `vtcall.py CTSGun 0x128` → `CTSGun::Deploy()`;
  `--file <decomp.c> CTSGun` annotates every `+0xNN))(` virtual call with its method (66 in CTSGun.c) — turns
  blind dispatch into named calls (SendWeaponAnim/Deploy/Precache/…). Uses vtables_original.json.
- **#3 server cvars — closed the coverage gap** (`coverage.py server_cvars_orig`): scans ts_i386.so .data for
  `cvar_t {name,default,...}` structs (the .rodata string ptrs are R_386_RELATIVE addends stored in-file) →
  41 matched / 5 missing (deadback/deadsitting/sv_alltalk/voice_serverdebug/weaponstay) / 258 EXTRA, of which
  **252 are stock-HL `sk_*` skill cvars** (monster/weapon damage tables) = a big HL-leftover cleanup target
  (TS has no HL monsters). Report collapses the sk_* family for readability. Default-mismatch detection too.
Remaining harness gap: user-message wire SIZES (pfnRegUserMsg site scan); cvar/engine-call USAGE tracing.

**Engine constants recovered:** ts_i386.so `_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_`=0x165e10 (PIC string-ref base);
client.dll cl_enginefuncs: pfnAddCommand=ds:0x100d5b6c, pfnRegisterVariable=ds:0x100d5b60,
pfnHookUserMsg=ds:0x100d5b70.

**Honest completeness:** DONE = the full by-NAME swap contract above. GAPS = server-side cvars + message
SIZES (ride GOT-relocated ptrs / cvar_t structs in the PIE — need R_386_RELATIVE reloc parsing); cvar/
engine-call USAGE tracing (semantic xref); internal C++ ABI/methods (OUT of scope — engine never sees it).
Spot-check Qs sent to the user (running the original): does `weapon_<N>` switch in console (validates the
cont.67 transport); what do tkw/tki/tka/rst_cfg/cashalarm do; do give/impulse 101 work (HL-leftover check);
is `buy` usable while alive; is cl_bob default really 4. NOT committed yet.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 67) — weapon-switch fidelity: drop invented tsnext/prevweapon → faithful weapon_<N> + lastinv (RE-grounded, in-engine verified)

User picked "weapon-switch fidelity" off the cont.66 known-unfaithful list. RE-FIRST (per
`check-re-on-feedback`) before any code; findings written to `reference/WEAPON_SELECT.md`.

**RE (client.dll cursor + ts_i386.so commit):**
- Imported client.dll + ts_i386.so into persistent Ghidra projects (`/tmp/ghidra-client`,
  `/tmp/ghidra-server`); DecompAt/DecompRefs by address. `scripts/ghidra/DecompAt.java` only
  resolves addresses Ghidra defined as functions — small thunks (the cmd handlers) needed
  raw `objdump -d -M intel` instead.
- **No `tsnextweapon`/`tsprevweapon`** anywhere (client cmd table nor server ClientCommand)
  — confirmed invented. Client cmds: invnext/invprev/slot1..10/+attack/+attack2/
  cancelselect/menuselect. Real **server** ClientCommand set (PIC base ebx=0x165E10, exact
  strcmp list): say, say_team, fov, use, respawn, powerup, cashalarm?, rst_cfg?, tkw, tki,
  tka, cutwire_*, drop_*, **drop**, **usepowerup**, **firemode**, **useitems**, **lastinv**,
  changeteam, jointeam, motd, fullupdate.
- Client cursor `FUN_1004f500(this,dir)` (invnext dir=1 @0x1004fce0 / invprev dir=0
  @0x1004fd40, both rate-limited): seeds (row 0x740, col 0x744) from the active weapon, steps
  the 17×5 grid skipping empties/akimbo-pairs + wraps; then if cvar **`hud_fastswitch`!=0**
  COMMITs by formatting **`"weapon_%i"`** (@0x10095db8) and sending it to the server (else
  the bar stays open at 0x73c for a +attack/slotN commit). → **commit transport =
  `weapon_<N>` console cmd** (numeric tsweapon_t).
- Server `CTSGun::SelectWeapon(type)` @0x80fb8 = HolsterWeapon(@0x85698) + set m_active
  (only if owned+valid); the **caller** (ClientCommand block @0xae433) does `if changed
  gun->Deploy()` (vtable+0x128). So switch = holster(old)→set→deploy(new). `lastinv` block
  saves player+0xa1c=current & re-selects the prior type. `CBasePlayer::SelectItem(char*)`
  is the stock by-CLASSNAME search — NOT the numeric path.

**Implemented + verified:**
- Server (`dlls/ts_gun.cpp`/`ts_weapons.h`/`client.cpp`): removed TSCycleWeapon/Prev +
  tsnext/prevweapon dispatch; `SelectSlot` now holster→deploy (cancels reload, records
  `m_lastActive`); `weapon_<N>` dispatch (strncmp+digit guard) → `TSSelectWeaponType` →
  FindSlot→SelectSlot; `lastinv` → `TSLastInv`.
- Client (`cl_dll/ts_weaponbar.{h,cpp}`/`ammo.cpp`): `CHudTSWeaponBar::CycleType(fNext)`
  walks owned weapons in the bar's column-major display order; invnext/invprev emit
  `ServerCmd("weapon_%d\n")`.
- Build amd64 all = clean (glibc 2.14); `nm|c++filt` shows TSSelectWeaponType/TSLastInv;
  no `tsnext/prevweapon` strings in either .so; `weapon_%d` in client.so. **In xash3d-fwgs
  (tm_avana), spawned in + mouse-wheel: rifle→akimbo pistols (invnext ×2), →single pistol
  (invprev), no crash, no "Unknown command".** Screenshots `/tmp/ws_{spawn,next,prev}.png`.

**Buy-menu availability (the cont.66 open Q):** CORRECTED by user ground truth — **`buy` IS
real** (original `ts/default.cfg` binds `b`→`buy`, also firemode/useitems/drop/usepowerup;
the `buy` string is in client.dll @0x10095b34 — I'd wrongly matched only the "1 Buy"/"2 Buy"
menu entries). cont.66's `buy` reopen is faithful. The menu is server-driven (gmsgShowMenu);
the exact dead/alive availability gate is a TODO for the coverage harness + a targeted RE of
the `buy` handler.

**Deferred (noted):** hud_fastswitch=0 open-bar + on-bar select highlight + literal (row,col)
grid cursor (we commit immediately + walk the compact owned-set). Separate fronts surfaced:
rename `tsfiremode`→`firemode`, `dropweapon`→`drop`; `usepowerup` IS real (HANDOFF's
"invented" note is wrong); buy cmds = tkw/tki/tka/rst_cfg/cashalarm.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 66) — TS join/spectate/buy-config/weapon-select flow (IN PROGRESS; some unfaithful stand-ins to fix)

User asked for the faithful join flow: a joining player does NOT spawn straight into play — they enter
free-look spectate, see a countdown → "Press fire to play", and pick a loadout from a buy/config menu first.
Plan: `~/.claude/plans/replicated-discovering-aho.md`. Used 3 Explore agents to map it (server spectator,
client buy-menu/countdown, buy backend + wiring patterns).

**DONE + verified (commits 0d4f2d0, 60a8c44, d1b0974, a1a8149):**
- **Spectate-gate (server):** `CBasePlayer::TSEnterSpectate` (StartObserver/OBS_ROAMING + respawn gate
  `respawntime` clamp 3..30 + ResetArmament), called at the end of `Spawn` when `m_fInSpectateWait`;
  `ClientPutInServer` sets the flag pre-Spawn; `CTSGameRules::PlayerSpawn` skips the loadout while waiting.
  `TSSpectateThink` (PreThink) drives the countdown; **+attack while !configChosen = select item 1,
  +attack after = `TSLeaveSpectate` → respawn into play**. Registered gmsg `Spectator`(2)/`VGUIMenu`(1).
- **Free-look HUD (client `cl_dll/ts_spectate.{cpp,h}`):** centre countdown → "Press fire to play" + the
  free-look help line; reads `Spectator`; `__MsgFunc_Spectator` repointed from the TFC viewport to it.
- **Buy/config menu — FAITHFUL mechanism:** the compact **`gmsgShowMenu` + `menuselect`** list (NOT a VGUI
  panel — I first wrongly built a VGUI MOTD-style panel; user corrected). RE'd from `client.dll FUN_10011160`
  (item 1 = Use New/Last/Empty Config; available items green). `TSSendBuyMenu`/`TSMenuSelect`/`TSCloseMenu`
  (`dlls/player.cpp`); client `CHudMenu` draws it, added `\g` green code (`cl_dll/menu.cpp`); resent each
  spectate tick (the first send can beat the client HUD). `buy` command reopens it (spectate-only). Verified:
  compact green-coded list matches the user's reference; click → "Using new config." + closes.
- **Weapon-bar layout (client `cl_dll/ts_weaponbar.cpp`):** RE'd from `FUN_1004e030` — 5 columns
  `x=col*0x80-0x78`, header panel + slot number (alpha 100 active/50 idle), weapons stacked 0x30/row with
  sprite icons (red when clip empty), active weapon name+ammo to the right. Verified vs reference.

**KNOWN-UNFAITHFUL / OPEN — the user set a hard REQUIREMENT (memory `check-re-on-feedback`): RE before coding,
and verify every console command exists in the original (it caught me inventing commands):**
- **Weapon switching uses INVENTED `tsnextweapon`/`tsprevweapon`** (client invnext/invprev forward to them,
  `cl_dll/ammo.cpp`). NOT in the original. Faithful: invnext/invprev move a **select cursor** (the `+0x7c0`
  select-active object in `FUN_1004d3f0`), **+attack commits**; switching plays **holster→deploy** (SelectSlot
  currently Deploys instantly).
- **Timed-powerup activation on invented `usepowerup`** — should be **double-tap `+use`(IN_USE) in PreThink**.
- **`tsbuy`/`tsarm`/`tsbuyarmament`/`tsresetarmament`/`tsbuyrandom`** are internal stand-ins; verify vs the
  original (BuyWeapon/BuyArmament are real functions; command names need RE).
- **Not built:** bar faint-when-idle fade; active **clip/maxclip "8/8"**; **powerup-timer HUD** (Slow Motion/
  Double Fire Rate green text above weapons, from `PwUpTime`); **kung-fu/super-jump icons** (centre-bottom);
  buy-menu **cursor + click-on-entries**; the **"2 Buy" weapon-category submenu**; menu **bg box**.
- **Open Q for user:** buy menu the whole dead-spectate, or only the join/respawn press-fire wait?

**Verification loop note (gotcha):** reading the Serena `ledger` memory returns ONE long single-line JSON
(`{result: "..."}`) that overflows the read limit — extract with `jq -r '.result' <savedfile> | head -c N`
or read the saved tool-result file in chunks; don't try to Read it whole.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 65) — CTSAnimation: reconstruct 3rd-person body/gait (fix the always-idle player), VERIFIED

Fixed the **biggest open item** (the player 3rd-person model was always idle — no walk/run/fire gait).

**Root cause (decomp-grounded):** the original `CBasePlayer::SetAnimation(PLAYER_ANIM)` is a **no-op stub**
(`@0xd8f50`, 21 bytes) — TS drives ALL body animation through `CTSAnimation::Animate` (`@0x6abd0`, called
from `PostThink` with activity 1=move / 6=idle, from `Duck`=5/`Jump`=4, and the weapon fire/reload/death
paths). Our build still ran the STOCK SDK SetAnimation, which looks up `"ref_aim_<ext>"`/`ACT_*` sequences
the TS `player.mdl` does NOT define (it ships `idle_/aim_/shoot_<grip>`, `run2`/`walk2`/`crawl`, `crouch_*`,
`standard_jump`, `die_*`, …; dumped all 171 seq names from `~/Containers/hlds/mods/ts/models/player.mdl`).
So every lookup returned -1 → sequence 0 (`empty`) → permanent idle.

**Reconstruction (`dlls/ts_animation.{h,cpp}`, `CTSAnimation m_TSAnim` embedded on CBasePlayer):** by
INTENT from the ~6.7KB Animate state machine (behaviour + the model/client contract is the target, not the
gcc2 byte layout — the decompile is hostile: pointer-to-member string-build loops + stack artifacts).
- `pev->sequence` (torso) = `shoot_`/`relo_`/`draw_`/`aim_`/`idle_` + grip, with `crouch_`/`duck_` variants;
  `standard_jump`/`jump_<dir>_<grip>`; `goduck`; `die_spin`; `grenade`. Grip = `m_szAnimExtention`
  (onehanded/twohanded/akimbo), already set by `CTSGun::Deploy` (the original's player+0x2d6).
- `pev->gaitsequence` (legs) = `crawl` (ducking+moving) / `run2` (>135 u/s) / `walk2` / 0. The client
  `StudioProcessGait` plays gaitsequence blended under the torso sequence (verified it reads the
  server-networked value, doesn't pick walk/run itself).
- aim-hold timer (`m_flAimTimer`=2.0 on fire/reload) protects the just-set shoot/relo torso pose from being
  overwritten by the per-frame idle path — mirrors the original's `param_1[3]` gate (`@0x6cf..`).

**Wiring:** `CBasePlayer::SetAnimation` rewritten to route the PLAYER_ANIM call sites →
`m_TSAnim.Animate` (JUMP/SUPERJUMP→4, DIE→7, ATTACK1→0, WALK→1, IDLE→6); `CTSGun` drives
reload(`relo_`,0x33)/deploy(`draw_`,0x34)/grenade(`grenade`,0x35) directly; `PreThink` decays the timers;
`Spawn` calls `Init()`. (Fire already routed via the existing `SetAnimation(PLAYER_ATTACK1)` call sites.)

**Deferred (CTSStunt-gated — CTSStunt is NOT ported, so these activity codes never fire):** dives
(0x28-0x2b,0x2e-0x30), cartwheels/walljump (0x31,0x32,0x37,0x38), morfy-jump (0x39), rolls/bullet-dance
(0x36), close-combat blends. The directional-aim 9-way movement blend (BlendAnimationsByDir) + death-by-
direction variants are also a refinement (we use die_spin). The `CTSAnimation::Init` string tables for the
deferred stunt names are intentionally not reproduced.

**Verified (xash3d-fwgs thirdperson, this box's GPU, `+thirdperson` on tm_avana; used xdotool to drive
keydown w / mousedown 1 / keydown ctrl + `import` screenshots):** armed standing idle pose (was broken),
walk/run **leg gait cycling** across frames, distinct **crouch** stance. No crash, no sequence-out-of-range
in the dev log. Server + client both build clean (amd64), `nm|c++filt` shows the 6 CTSAnimation methods.
Committed `2c44837`.

**NEXT:** fire/aim torso pose is hard to confirm from the behind-camera (works structurally; a front view or
rcbot would confirm); directional-aim strafe blend (BlendAnimationsByDir) for proper 8-way movement;
death-direction variants; then `CTSStunt` (which unlocks the deferred Animate branches) + full pmove
time-dilation. See `reference/ENGINE_INTERFACE.md` "notable gaps".

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 64) — playtest fixes: fire-anim regression, 3rd-person camera, coldcock sound

User playtested (cont.61–63 build) and reported issues; fixed three:
- **Viewmodel fire animation REGRESSION (I caused it in cont.56).** Moving the anim to the predicted
  event's `EV_WeaponAnimation` broke it — that doesn't stick because CTSGun isn't client-predicted.
  Restored the server-driven `SendWeaponAnim(iFireAnim)` + `EF_MUZZLEFLASH` in `CTSGun::StandardFire`
  (the working cont.49 path); the event now only does fire sound + brass shell + viewmodel muzzleflash
  (removed EV_WeaponAnimation from EV_TSFire).
- **3rd-person camera = side profile, should be behind.** `cam_idealyaw` default was 90 (= camAngles[YAW]
  = 90 + viewYaw → side). Changed to **0** (directly behind, looking the player's direction). VERIFIED by
  screenshot: player now seen from behind facing into the room.
- **+alt2 coldcock played a KNIFE sound (wrong).** Swapped the knife_hitbody/miss sounds for
  `player/kungfuhit.wav` (a melee-bash impact) on hit, silent on miss.

**Still open from the playtest (NOT yet fixed):**
- **Player 3rd-person model is always idle** (no walk/run/fire gait) — this is the `CTSAnimation` gait
  subsystem (PostThink, NOT ported; cont.60). Big remaining piece (movement/anim, client-entangled).
- **+alt1 does nothing** — expected; it's an xash built-in + the silencer is UNMAPPED (VERIFICATION §B).
- damagemult untested (no enemy; needs rcbot in xash).

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 63c) — wire `initial_cash` cvar → starting cash (cash HUD lights up), VERIFIED

`CTSGameRules::PlayerSpawn` (`dlls/ts_teams.cpp`) now gives `initial_cash` (cvar) via `GiveCash` once per
fresh life (`if m_iCash == 0`), so the player starts with cash. **Verified WITH a screenshot:** launched
`+initial_cash 5000` → the bottom-left cash HUD shows "$5000" — confirming the whole chain (cvar →
GiveCash → m_iCash → TSCash message → CHudTSStatus reader). Ties the cvar wiring to a visible HUD element.
`cashforwin`/`cashforlose` (round-end award via TeamWin) still TODO. API_SURFACE §6c: initial_cash ★wired.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 63b) — wire `damagemult` cvar → weapon damage scale

`damagemult` cvar (default 0.0 = off → 1x; >0 scales) now multiplies all TS weapon damage via a
`TSDamageMult()` helper (`dlls/ts_gun.cpp`, `CVAR_GET_FLOAT`) applied at all 5 damage points: StandardFire/
ShotgunFire (FireBulletsPlayer), AkimboFire, MeleeAttack, ColdCock, GrenadeThrow. Builds clean; the
cvar-read pattern is proven (roundtime/slowmatch). Combat scaling itself needs a playtest shot to confirm
on-screen (combat-gated). API_SURFACE §6c: damagemult ★wired.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 63) — pfnGetGameDescription → "The Specialists (mode)"

`CTSGameRules::GetGameDescription` (new override, `dlls/ts_teams.cpp`) returns the mod name shown in the
server browser, per mode (recovered .so strings): "The Specialists (Teamplay)" if IsTeamMode, "(The One)"
if mp_theonemode, "(LMS)" if lastmanstanding, else "(DM)". Was returning the SDK "Half-Life". Verified:
strings present in hl.so. ENGINE_INTERFACE.md: pfnGetGameDescription ✅. Remaining interface gaps now:
full pmove time-dilation (gravity/jumps/anim), PlayerPostThink (CTSAnimation/CTSStunt), HUD_PostRunCmd
(client weapon prediction), TS save/restore field data.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 62) — VISIBLE slow-motion movement (the marquee TS effect), VERIFIED

Wired the biggest tracked interface gap: slow-motion is now VISIBLE. `CBasePlayer::PreThink` scales the
speed cap by the applied slow factor — `pev->maxspeed = 320 * m_flSlowMotionGo` when slowed (`m_flSlowMotionGo`
in (0,1)), restoring to the engine default (0) on exit (tracked by new `m_bSlowMoveApplied`). pev->maxspeed
flows to pmove via clientdata (client.cpp:1944), so a slowed player physically moves slower. This makes the
whole complete-but-invisible server slow state (GoSlow/InSlow/GlobalSlowMotion2/slowmatch/CTSSlowMotionPoint/
powerup slow) actually do something on screen. **Verified WITHOUT input:** `+slowmatch 0.5` → log probe
"[TS] slow-move: maxspeed 160 (scale 0.50)" (320→160); probe removed, rebuilt clean.
- SLICE: full pmove time-dilation (gravity/jump arcs/animation rate) needs the slow value threaded into
  client-predicted pm_shared — the complete effect. This is the server-side speed portion.
- ENGINE_INTERFACE.md: pfnPM_Move gap ❌→🟡.

Also this session (cont.61): thirdperson MP-gate fix; ENGINE_INTERFACE.md (full callback tracking).

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 61) — fix thirdperson (MP gate) + track the FULL engine↔mod interface (the goal)

- **`thirdperson` FIXED + VERIFIED.** The stock HL client's `CAM_ToThirdPerson` (`cl_dll/in_camera.cpp`)
  hard-returns `if (GetMaxClients() > 1)` ("no thirdperson in multiplayer") — TS runs as MP, so the
  command did nothing (the user's report). TS permits third-person (it's a real feature); removed the gate.
  Verified by launching `+thirdperson` → screenshot shows the player model from behind.
- **FULL interface tracking — `reference/ENGINE_INTERFACE.md` (new), per the mission goal "all engine calls
  and callbacks."** Enumerated + status-tracked every engine↔mod entry point: (1) engine→server
  `DLL_FUNCTIONS` (~46 callbacks, from cbase.cpp) + NEW_DLL_FUNCTIONS; (2) engine→client cldll exports
  (~45, from cdll_int.cpp); (3) the by-name protocol (→ API_SURFACE/HUD_MESSAGES); (4) mod→engine calls.
  Each marked ✅faithful / 🟡partial / ⬜stock-inherited / ❌missing. **The real remaining interface GAPS
  (highlighted there):** `pfnPM_Move`+`HUD_PlayerMove` = the VISIBLE slow-motion time-dilation (scale pmove
  frametime by the slow field — nothing reads the complete server slow state in movement; biggest gap),
  `pfnPlayerPostThink` = CTSAnimation+CTSStunt, `HUD_PostRunCmd` = client CTSGun prediction,
  `pfnGetGameDescription` = "The Specialists", TS save/restore field data.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 60) — status tracking: think behaviour, cvar/cmd impl status, playtest checklist + silencer

Answered the user's tracking questions with durable docs.
- **Think behaviour — PARTIAL (not all ported).** Original `CBasePlayer::PostThink` calls
  `CTSAnimation::Animate` (gait/anim subsystem, 14 funcs), `CTSStunt::GoRoll` (stunts, 25 funcs) and
  `CheckPowerups` — **none ported**. We have PreThink→`UpdatePowerUpState`, `UpdateClientData`(+TS HUD),
  and `CTSGameRules::Think` (deads/round/powerups/slowmatch). The CTSAnimation + CTSStunt subsystems are
  the remaining per-tick gap (movement/animation, client-entangled). Recorded in `reference/VERIFICATION.md` §C.
- **cvar/cmd implementation status — now TRACKED** in `reference/API_SURFACE.md` §6c: a R(egistered)/read/
  ★wired table for every TS cvar + command. Wired so far: roundtime, slowmatch, hud_r/g/b, +alt2/coldcock,
  + the server console gameplay cmds. The rest are R-only; `damagemult` flagged as the next wiring candidate.
- **Playtest checklist + silencer tracking — `reference/VERIFICATION.md` (new).** §A: 9-item playtest
  checklist with exact steps (HUD ×3, round clock, predicted fire, fire-sound pitch, coldcock, slowmatch,
  no-spam) for the user to confirm. §B: the silencer/`+alt1` assembly findings + what to implement + how to
  verify (it's UNMAPPED; the `-sil.wav` files exist; the install state rides the WeaponInfo flags byte +
  player+0x798 mask). §C: the think-status above.

No code this entry — documentation/assessment.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 59) — wire the `slowmatch` cvar into gameplay (global slow-motion match), VERIFIED

Wired a registered cvar into actual behaviour (the user asked for a verifiable cvar→gameplay hookup).
`CTSGameRules::Think` now reads `slowmatch` (cont.54 cvar, default 1.0): a value in (0,1) runs the WHOLE
match in global slow-motion at that scale via the already-tested `GlobalSlowMotion2(sm,0)` (self-throttled,
re-applied each Think); returning to >=1.0 restores once (`GlobalSlowMotion2(0,0)`), tracked by new
`m_bSlowMatchActive`. **Verified WITHOUT in-game input:** launched xash with `+slowmatch 0.5` → log printed
the (temporary) probe "[TS] SlowMatch ON: scale 0.50", confirming the cvar is read + applied; probe removed,
rebuilt clean. (The slow path itself — GlobalSlowMotion2 → GoSlow/InSlow — was runtime-verified earlier,
cont.15/33.) This is the launch-arg verification pattern for cvar→gameplay wiring.

**Checkpoint still stands:** the remaining input-gated gameplay (the +alt1 silencer is also UNMAPPED, cont.58;
stunts; buy menu; true client prediction) needs a USER PLAYTEST to verify. Other mapped+verifiable cvar
wirings available next: `damagemult` (damage scale), `cashforwin`/`cashforlose`/`initial_cash` (the economy).

---

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 58) — finding: SecondaryAttack = IN_ATTACK2 dispatch; +alt1 silencer NOT mapped; PLAYTEST checkpoint

Scoped the `+alt1` silencer/scope toggle (next gameplay item). Findings, no code (avoided speculation):
- `CTSGun::SecondaryAttack @0x717a8` is the **IN_ATTACK2 fire-type dispatcher**, NOT the silencer: branches
  on the active weapon's fire-type (s_weapon_info+0x348) — no active item → `CCombatAttack` (unarmed combat),
  type 2 → `GrenadeFire`, type 3 → (knife branch), etc. A real recoverable dispatch, but input-gated gameplay.
- `CTSGun::AlternateAttack @0x81ba8` = ColdCock (done cont.57); `Zoom`/`Unzoom` are forwarders.
- The **`+alt1` silencer/scope toggle handler is not cleanly located** — no server-side "silenc"/attachment
  name strings to anchor on (only client.dll has "/HUD/Silencer"); the install logic is diffuse. Recovering
  it would be speculative RE, and like all the remaining gameplay it's INPUT-GATED (can't self-verify here).

**Checkpoint reached:** the remaining work is all input-gated gameplay (silencer, stunts, buy menu, true
client prediction) that can't be self-verified without a playtest. Recommended a USER PLAYTEST of the
cont.51–57 build (HUD 3 regions, fire event, coldcock, cvars/round timer) to surface real issues before
stacking more unverifiable features. Did not implement +alt1 (unmapped + unverifiable).

---

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 57) — gameplay: +alt2 coldcock (pistol-whip)

First command-gameplay behaviour wired. `CTSGun::AlternateAttack` (@0x81ba8) + `CTSGun::ColdCock`
(@0x71dd0, calls CBasePlayer::ColdCockAttack@0x86610 in the .so) reconstructed in `dlls/ts_gun.cpp`:
AlternateAttack coldcocks when the held weapon has a round loaded (the .so gates on active clip > 0);
ColdCock is a short hull-trace melee bash (40u forward, 25 club damage, knife hit/miss sounds, 0.5s
cadence, 3rd-person attack anim). Free fn `TSAlternateAttack(player)` (declared ts_weapons.h) finds the
held gun + fires it. Server `ClientCommand` "+alt2" → `TSAlternateAttack` (`dlls/client.cpp`); the client
already forwards +alt2 (cont.56). Precached the two knife sounds in `CTSGun::Precache`.
- **Verified:** builds, loads + runs on tm_avana, sounds precache, no crash/unknown-command for +alt2.
  **NOT functionally confirmed** (can't press +alt2 without interactive input) — needs a user playtest.
  SLICE: the faithful coldcock viewmodel anim rides events/coldcock.sc (not reconstructed); we drive the
  3rd-person anim + sound server-side.
- **Leftover config warnings (minor, not chased):** the TS config sets engine `s_*` sound cvars (xash
  names them differently), `sv_language`/`sv_voicecodec` (engine), and `weaponrestriction`/`weaponstay`
  (the latter is the mp_-prefix-vs-bare-name mismatch — the base SDK registers the struct but maybe under
  a different name string). Low value.

---

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 56) — Phase 5 (partial): faithful events/fire.sc → EV_TSFire (sound/flash/anim/shell)

Moved weapon firing onto the original's event path. **Server** (`dlls/ts_gun.cpp`): `CTSGun` precaches
`m_usFire = PRECACHE_EVENT(1,"events/fire.sc")`; `StandardFire` now `PLAYBACK_EVENT_FULL(0, player, m_usFire,
…, fparam1/2=spread, iparam1=m_weaponType, bparam1=(clip==0))` instead of the server `EMIT_SOUND` +
`SendWeaponAnim` slice (cont.49) — bullets still fire server-side. **Client** (`cl_dll/ev_ts.cpp`, hooked in
`hl_events.cpp` Game_HookEvents): `EV_TSFire` reads weapontype → viewmodel muzzleflash + "shoot" anim
(local player) + brass shell eject + the per-weapon fire sound (client sound/anim tables mirroring
`ts_weapons.cpp`). Adds the viewmodel muzzleflash + shell the server-driven slice lacked.
- **Event is SERVER-triggered, not yet client-PREDICTED** — true prediction needs CTSGun client-side
  weapon prediction (HUD_PostRunCmd), a separate subsystem. This is the event-layer prerequisite for it.
- **Commands fix:** xash3d-fwgs provides `+alt1`/`+break`/`+commandmenu`/`ForceCloseCommandMenu`/`special`
  as ENGINE BUILT-INS (re-registering errors "already defined"). Trimmed `ts_commands.cpp` to register only
  the ones xash lacks (`+alt2`/`-alt2`, `buy`, `togglebrowser`); the built-ins forward to the server, which
  accepts them (cont.54). Clean run now: no "already defined", no crashes.
- **Verified:** builds (server+client), loads + runs on tm_avana, event hooked + precached, no errors.
  **NOT visually confirmed firing** (can't trigger a shot without interactive input) — the muzzleflash/shell/
  sound/anim need a user playtest shot; the path mirrors the working stock EV_FireGlock so confidence is high.
  AkimboFire still uses its own EMIT_SOUND (not moved to the event yet).

---

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 55) — Phase 2 (low-pitch fire sound): investigated, NO defect found in our code

Chased the cont.50 "regular fire sound is low-pitched/slow-mo" report. The fire-sound path is verifiably
CORRECT end-to-end — found no defect:
- Server emits ONE sound: `EMIT_SOUND(ENT, CHAN_WEAPON, wi->pszFireSound, VOL_NORM, ATTN_NORM)` =
  `EMIT_SOUND_DYN(..., 0, PITCH_NORM)` (ts_gun.cpp StandardFire/AkimboFire). Normal pitch.
- No duplicate source: the client's `EMIT_SOUND_DYN` is a no-op stub (cl_dll/hl/hl_baseentity.cpp:33),
  and the client only hooks the stock HL events (ev_hldm.cpp), none of which fire for `weapon_tsgun`
  (we don't PLAYBACK_EVENT stock events for it).
- No global time-scale: our slow-motion only sets the per-player member `m_flSlowMotionGo`; nothing
  touches host_framerate/maxspeed/etc., and sound pitch isn't pitched server-side by slow-mo at all.
- Files fine: TS fire wavs are 8-bit mono 22050 Hz — byte-IDENTICAL in format to the valve sounds xash
  plays at correct pitch. xash audio runs @44100 and resamples 22050 fine (valve sounds prove it).
- Engine note (benign): xash warns `CL_LoadProgs: failed to get address of HUD_GetSoundInterface` — the
  stock HL client doesn't export that xash3d-fwgs sound hook; absence → default sound (normal pitch).
**Conclusion:** no reproducible low-pitch in the current build (much changed since cont.50). Most likely
already-fixed, or was heard during an actual slow-motion state (correct behaviour). Did NOT edit the
correct sound code. If it recurs: capture which weapon, slow-mo or not, all-sounds-vs-fire-only; the
faithful long-term path is the predicted `events/fire.sc`→EV_TSFire (Phase 5), which plays at PITCH_NORM
too (won't change pitch). Cannot self-verify audio (no way to trigger a shot + capture without input).

---

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 54) — Phase 3: TS client cvars + commands registered (kills "Unknown command" spam)

Wired the TS-specific client cvars + console commands from the API surface scan, fixing the playtest
"Unknown command" spam + non-erroring keybinds.
- **Cvars (`cl_dll/ts_hud.cpp` TSHud_RegisterCvars):** registered ~25 TS client cvars with the EXACT
  defaults recovered from client.dll (API_SURFACE.md) — hud_r/g/b/color, cl_realhud/motionblur/gore/laser/
  lasercolor/solidcross/usepowerup/buykevlar/showequipment/shadow/thirdtransparency/camtype/attackswitch/
  thirdpersonswitch/wavedetail/fx/slowfade/vsmoothing, hud_classautokill/takesshots, nohud, r_paintball.
  (Registration only — most aren't *read* yet; stock/engine cvars left to the base client.)
- **Commands (`cl_dll/ts_commands.cpp`, `TSRegisterCommands` from InitInput):** `+alt1`/`-alt1`/`+alt2`/
  `-alt2`/`+break`/`-break`/`special`/`buy` forward to the server via ServerCmd; `+commandmenu`/`-commandmenu`/
  `ForceCloseCommandMenu`/`togglebrowser` are client UI stubs. Server (`dlls/client.cpp` ClientCommand) now
  accepts the forwarded TS inputs silently so they don't print "Unknown command" server-side.
- **Verified:** launched on tm_avana, NO "Unknown command" for any TS cvar/command in the log; game runs.
- **TODO (gameplay behind the commands, follow-on):** alt-fire/silencer-scope toggle (+alt1), coldcock
  (+alt2 = AlternateAttack@0x81ba8, found cont.53), stunts (special), the buy menu (cl_dll VGUI).

**Server cvar scan (task #5) DONE:** extracted the TS server cvars from the .so cvar_t structs (parsed
R_386_RELATIVE relocs → name/default pairs). Registered the ~25 TS-specific ones our server lacked in
`dlls/ts_cvars.cpp` (`TSRegisterCvars` from GameDLLInit) with exact defaults: mp_teammodels, initial_cash/
cashforwin/cashforlose, **roundtime 150 (WIRED → StartRoundTimer, replacing the hardcoded 120 — clock now
2:30)**, respawntime, damagemult, slowmatch, nopowerup, botlearn, realbullet, usecash, ammocount, bottalk,
mp_theonemode/theone/theothers, lastmanstanding, spectacularness, respawnnumber, customweapons, banfortk,
dmgreport, botarmor, deadstomach. Verified: no "Unknown command" for any TS cvar; round clock reads 150s.
TODO: server *console-command* + event enumeration (the standard mp_* alias names too); behaviour wiring
for the registered cvars (only roundtime read so far).

---

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 53) — DEEP RE of the HUD draw chain from client.dll (user mandate) → reference/HUD_DRAWCHAIN.md

User chose byte-exact RE over visual-match (visual can't verify alpha-blended fidelity). Traced the FULL
per-frame HUD render path from `client.dll` assembly using a new `scripts/ghidra/DecompAt.java` (decompile
a function by address; null-safe + whitespace-split args + dedup). Findings in **reference/HUD_DRAWCHAIN.md**:
- `HUD_Redraw`(export 0x1001aa90) → `CHud::Redraw` `FUN_10021aa0`(gHUD=0x100cf920) walks the element list,
  calls **`elem->vtable[+0xc](time)` = Draw**; `m_iFlags` at elem+0x10.
- The TS HUD is ONE singleton **`0x100d43cc`** (Init `0x10049b80` hooks all msgs; fields: health+0x20,
  armor+0x21, state+0x22, cash+0x24, flags+0x10, active-slot+0x744, weapon-id+0x7b8). Its **vtable =
  `0x1007cae4`**, Draw = vtable[+0xc] = **`0x1004d3f0`**.
- Draw `0x1004d3f0` dispatches: `FUN_1004e6f0` (static crosshair, 2×2 FillRGBA dots, cl_lasercolor),
  `FUN_1004e030` (**top weapon-select bar**: slot panels x=slot*0x80-0x78, y=8, w=0x80, h=0x14 + name text
  + SPR icon), `FUN_1004d700`/`FUN_1004d7e0` (**status+ammo box**), `FUN_1004e9f0` (dynamic spread
  crosshair), `FUN_1004d550` (bomb wires).
- **`FUN_1004d7e0` = the status/ammo box (the Five-seveN/MP5K panel):** each line = `FillRGBA(x=DAT_1018a67c,
  y=DAT_1018a700, w=0x80=128px, h≈lineheight, hud_r,g,b, **alpha 0x0f**)` + text `FUN_10021ce0(x+2,y,…)`.
  **Labels drawn at HALF brightness (color/2 = 75/87/127), values at full.** Numbers via `FUN_1004c290`.
- Engine fn globals: FillRGBA=`0x100d5b54`, SPR_Set=`0x100d5b38`, SPR_Draw=`0x100d5b44`.

**Applied (recovered, not guessed):** `TSHud_Panel` now fills with the HUD colour at **alpha 0x0f** (a
faint tint, matching FUN_1004d7e0) instead of the earlier guessed opaque dark navy. Built clean.

**THREE HUD regions (cont.53):** (1) **ammo box** ✅ exact geometry, verified; (2) **health BAR** ✅
`FUN_1004d5f0` — a fill bar (not text), 0x80 wide, fill ∝ health (red when low), bg alpha 0x1e, drawn
stacked above the ammo box; `TSHud_HealthBar` + shared `g_iTSHealth`, verified on-screen; (3) **weapon-
select bar** (top) ✅ DONE — server `CTSGun::SendWeaponStatus` sends `WStatus(3)={type,owned,clip}` per
arsenal weapon on change; client `CHudTSWeaponBar` (`cl_dll/ts_weaponbar.{cpp,h}`) draws held weapons in
5 category columns at the recovered `FUN_1004e030` geometry (x=col*0x80-0x78, y=8, 0x80×0x14), active
highlighted. Column per weapon = its `s_weapon_info+0x84` byte, EXTRACTED from the .so Write_<weapon>
funcs (the bar's grid TRANSPOSES the WStatus handler's (slot*0xb+pos): draw col = +0x84 [1=melee/grenade
2=pistols 3=SMGs 4=rifles/shotguns/heavy 5=akimbo], row = +0x85). Verified: "Beretta" shows in column 2.
**ALL THREE HUD REGIONS now covered** (weapon-bar + ammo box + health bar), each from recovered geometry.
**Text/font RESOLVED:** `FUN_10021ce0` draws per-char via `pfnDrawCharacter` advancing by SCREENINFO
charWidths, clipped to maxX — i.e. the ENGINE HUD font (no custom bitmap font; the "bitmapfonts" worry was
wrong). Ported faithfully as `TSHud_DrawString` (clip to panel width) + used by the ammo box & weapon bar.
**Finding (for the attachment system / +alt work):** `CTSGun::AlternateAttack @0x81ba8` = **ColdCock**
(pistol-whip melee bash) when the active clip > 0 — NOT the silencer toggle. So the attachment system
(silencer/laser support + toggle, which would light up the ammo box's Silencer/Lasersight rows +
`item_installed.spr` dots) lives elsewhere in the weapon code and is a distinct gameplay feature, not HUD
polish. The HUD attachment rows need the WeaponInfo flags byte (currently sent as 0) driven by that system.

**Weapon ICONS DONE:** the bar now draws each held weapon's `sprites/weapons/<name>.spr` (SPR_Load in
VidInit + SPR_DrawAdditive centred in the slot; name table from the client.dll string list, all 38 files
present in the mod). Verified: the Beretta pistol icon renders in column 2. Active weapon full-colour,
others dimmed. Remaining polish (low priority): the active-highlight timing + attachment dots
(`item_installed.spr`) which need the WeaponInfo flags byte. All in HUD_DRAWCHAIN.md.

**Anchor constants RESOLVED + APPLIED (cont.53, from the top of FUN_1004d7e0):** raw pixels off actual
screen size — **x = ScreenWidth−0x88(136), box w=0x80(128), lineH=0x14(20), lines stack UP from
y=ScreenHeight−8, strip = FillRGBA(...,alpha 0x0f)**, descriptive lines (caliber/mode) at half brightness,
name+ammo at full. Rewrote `cl_dll/ts_ammo.cpp` to this exact geometry → VERIFIED on-screen: "Beretta 92F /
9 x 19mm / Semi Auto / 15 / 45" right-anchored, dim labels, faint strips — matches reference Image #4/#6.

**STILL TODO to pixel-match (next, from HUD_DRAWCHAIN.md):** the TS **bitmap font** (`FUN_10021ce0`,
`bitmapfonts` cvar — we use DrawConsoleString); the **left status block** (health/armor/free-slots — trace
`FUN_1004d700`?) + **weapon-select bar** (`FUN_1004e030`, WStatus reader) with the same recovered approach;
the WeaponInfo **flags byte** server-side so the Silencer/Lasersight attachment rows draw. New Ghidra
tooling: `DecompAt.java`, `DecompRefs.java`.

---

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 52) — ammo HUD (WeaponInfo) + the COMPLETE client API surface scan + steel-blue panels

**Ammo HUD (`WeaponInfo`) reconstructed + VISUALLY VERIFIED.** Decoded the `s_weapon_status` slot struct
(0x38 bytes) from `CTSGun::TakeWeapon @0x80a04`: slot+0x4=clip, +0x2=fireMode, +0x8=caliber, +0x10=flags.
So `WeaponInfo`(6) = BYTE weaponType, BYTE clip, SHORT reserve, BYTE fireMode, BYTE flags — and
CTSGun NEVER sends `ClipInfo` (clip rides in WeaponInfo). Server: `CTSGun::UpdateClientData` override
(`dlls/ts_gun.cpp`) sends it on-change (type/clip/reserve[caliber]/mode; flags=0 SLICE). Client:
`CHudTSAmmo` (`cl_dll/ts_ammo.{cpp,h}`) draws the original's stacked box — name / caliber / fire-mode /
"clip / reserve". Screenshot on tm_avana: "Beretta 92F / 9 x 19mm / Semi Auto / 14 / 45". User sent
reference screenshots confirming the exact layout (Five-seveN/MP5K panels) + a left-HUD (team/health-
heart/free-slots) + the weapon-select bar.

**HUD colour + style recovered from client.dll (the user pushed for disasm of the draw calls):**
- `pfnFillRGBA` is engine-table offset 0x2c; the HUD panels are FillRGBA with VARIABLE (cvar-driven)
  colours, called via gEngfuncs @ `0x100d5c70`.
- **The HUD text colour = the `hud_r`/`hud_g`/`hud_b` cvars, RegisterVariable defaults 150/175/255**
  (steel blue) — `hud_color "150,175,255"`. Recovered by parsing the RegisterVariable call args.
- New `cl_dll/ts_hud.{cpp,h}`: registers hud_r/g/b/hud_color/cl_realhud (faithful defaults), `TSHud_Color`
  reads them, `TSHud_Panel` draws the dark translucent backing. ts_status + ts_ammo now use steel-blue
  text + panels. **NOTE (user-flagged): panel geometry/alpha are still APPROXIMATE — not yet traced from
  the original Draw chain (task #4).**

**FULL CLIENT API SURFACE SCAN → `reference/API_SURFACE.md` (new, tracked).** The user's directive: the
complete engine↔client contract = the behavioural surface; scan it all + ledger completeness. Recovered
ALL of it from client.dll by finding the engine func-ptr-global call sites (`ff 15 <ptr>`):
- `0x100d5b60` RegisterVariable → **104 cvars** (TS-specific ~30: hud_r/g/b ✅, cl_realhud/motionblur/gore/
  laser/solidcross/usepowerup/thirdperson/…; rest stock).
- `0x100d5b6c` AddCommand → **92 commands** (TS-specific: `+alt1`/`+alt2`/`+break`/`special`/`buy`/
  `togglebrowser`/`+commandmenu`/`ForceCloseCommandMenu`; rest stock +/- input). NONE implemented client-side.
- `0x100d5b70` HookUserMsg → **74 messages read** (the definitive read-side list; ✅5 readers, 🟡1, ❌~24 TS).
- `0x100d5c3c` PrecacheEvent → **11 events** (closecombat/coldcock/draw/empty/fire/firelinked/grenade/
  katana/knife/pump/reload) — all ❌ client EV_ callbacks (server playback ✅).

**Honest state correction (the user's point):** the SERVER was reconstructed surface-first via the ENTITY
surface (FGD + .so factories); the CLIENT API surface was being done reactively (per playtest bug), not
enumerated first. API_SURFACE.md now fixes that for the client. Still partial: server cvar/command/event
scan (task #5), and the EXACT HUD draw chain (geometry/alpha/font) from assembly (task #4 — the current
panels are approximations, which is why the look isn't pixel-matching the original yet).

**Built + ran** (amd64 server+client) in xash3d-fwgs; ammo box verified on-screen. cont.51's health/armor
panels also restyled. No message-size warnings.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 51) — Phase 4: TS custom HUD begins (health/armor/cash) + the user-message wire contract recovered + 3 protocol-name bugs fixed

**Phase 4 (the TS custom HUD) started.** First recovered the FULL TS user-message contract from the
`.so`, then landed the first faithful HUD elements (health/armor/cash) end-to-end (server send + client
draw), VISUALLY VERIFIED in xash3d-fwgs.

**The message contract — recovered + documented in `reference/HUD_MESSAGES.md` (new, tracked).** Parsed
`LinkUserMessages @0xc7db0` (every REG_USER_MSG name + fixed size) and decompiled the two senders —
`CBasePlayer::UpdateClientData @0x81d00` and `CTSGun::UpdateClientData @0x758c8` — for the exact wire
packing. The TS block (names ON THE WIRE, sizes, format): `TSHealth`(1)=BYTE round(health)≥0,
`TSArmor`(1)=BYTE round(armor), `TSState`(1)=BYTE state[0x498], `TSCash`(2)=SHORT cash, `TSSpace`(1)=BYTE,
`WeaponInfo`(6)=BYTE wtype,BYTE,SHORT reserve,BYTE,BYTE (from the per-arsenal-slot struct @gun+0xcc, NOT
our s_weapon_info subset), `WStatus`(3)=per-slot BYTE×3, `ActItems`(2)=MSG_ALL BYTE entindex+BYTE,
`TSPAward`(2)=MSG_ALL, `PwUp`(3), `PwUpTime`(1), `RoundTime`(2)=BYTE secs+BYTE flag(0 start/2 timeout),
`TSMBlur`(2), `TSSlowMo`(2)=COORD(slowamt*100), `TSBTime`(1), `Wires`(3), `TSFrags`(-1), `TSPSys`(-1)…
Engine write-fn GOT offsets: `190fe0`=Byte `190fe8`=Short `190fec`=Long `190ff4`=Coord.

**3 inherited PROTOCOL-NAME/SIZE bugs fixed (swap-compat — the cont.50 mandate):**
- `RoundTime`: was registered -1 + written as TWO SHORTS (server) / read as two shorts (client). Original
  is **fixed size 2 = two BYTES** (seconds, flag). Fixed `dlls/ts_gamerules.cpp` (StartRoundTimer +
  SendRoundTime → WRITE_BYTE×2, REG size 2) AND `cl_dll/roundtime.cpp` (READ_BYTE×2). Clock still
  counts down correctly (verified "1:42"); 120s round max fits a byte.
- `TSMotionBlur` → **`TSMBlur`** (size 2) — wrong NAME + size (`dlls/ts_player.cpp`).
- `TSPowerUpTime` → **`PwUpTime`** (size 1) — wrong NAME (`dlls/ts_player.cpp`).

**Health/armor/cash HUD — DONE + VISUALLY VERIFIED:**
- Server (`dlls/ts_player.cpp` `CBasePlayer::TSUpdateClientData()`, called at the end of
  `CBasePlayer::UpdateClientData`): lazily registers + sends `TSHealth`(byte)/`TSArmor`(byte)/`TSCash`
  (short) on-change, cached in new `player.h` members (`m_iClientTSHealth/Armor/Cash`, reset on HUD init
  so they resend after respawn). Byte-faithful to the original (round+clamp health, round armor). The
  original sends THESE instead of stock Health/Battery — TS has a fully custom HUD.
- Client (`cl_dll/ts_status.{cpp,h}`, new — `CHudTSStatus`): hooks TSHealth/TSArmor/TSCash, draws
  "Health: N" / "Armor: N" / "$N" as text bottom-left (DrawHudString, gold / red when health≤25). Wired
  into hud.h/hud.cpp/CMakeLists like CHudRoundTime. Built both halves (amd64), nm/strings confirm the
  factories + hook names; ran in xash3d-fwgs on tm_avana → screenshot shows **"Health: 100" / "Armor: 0"**
  bottom-left + the round clock. No "Bad message" size warnings in the log.

**STILL TO DO in Phase 4 (next):**
- **AMMO HUD (the big one) — `WeaponInfo`/`WStatus` need the per-arsenal-slot struct (@gun+0xcc, 0x70/slot)
  decoded** to pin the 6 WeaponInfo bytes byte-faithfully (weapontype + reserve are known; the clip + the
  3 middle bytes come from the slot struct, which our modern `CTSGun` stores differently). CTSGun sends
  WeaponInfo/WStatus, NEVER ClipInfo — so the current clip rides inside WeaponInfo's slot snapshot. This
  is a consult-worthy ambiguity (raised to the user/prev-agent): exact slot-struct field meanings.
- `TSState` (player state byte @0x498 — semantics TBD), `TSSlowMo` (COORD slowamt — the visible
  time-dilation HUD), `TSBTime`, `PwUp`/motion-blur HUD readers, `TSFrags`/scoreboard.
- The leftover **stock HUD strip** still bleeds through at the very bottom (faint "00 |", player icon, "0")
  — the stock sprite HUD half-loading; should be suppressed once the TS HUD is complete.

**Verify loop used:** `scripts/build.sh amd64` + `amd64 client` → `setup-xash-mod.sh` → launched xash
(killed the 26-min idle prior instance first) → `import -window root` → cropped the 2560x1080+1280+208
window (`xwininfo` for geometry). Left a fresh instance running for the user.

## 2026-06-22 (cont. 50) — playtest reconstruction (reload, akimbo anims, HUD res) + the COMPAT TARGET clarified + docs sync

**Compatibility target clarified by the user (now in CLAUDE.md + HANDOFF):** the goal is INTERFACE/
protocol compatibility so each half is a **drop-in swap** for the original — our client ↔ the original
server (or vice-versa) behaves identically. Byte-faithful: the engine C interface + the client↔server
protocol (user-message **names + wire formats**, **event** names/params, **command** names, **cvar**
names). NOT a target: the internal C++ ABI / member offsets / gcc-2.x quirks (we build on the newer
Itanium-ABI halflife-updated SDK). This is exactly why `TSRoundTime`→`RoundTime` mattered, and it makes
protocol-level decomp fidelity mandatory for every message/event/command/cvar going forward.

**Done this session (all decomp-grounded, committed):**
- **Akimbo fire anims (e5ca177)** — `AkimboFire` SendWeaponAnim's the matching barrel's shoot sequence
  (right=`iFireAnim`, left=`iFireAnimL`, parsed from the `v_*_akimbo.mdl`). User-confirmed: anims + flare
  side switch correctly.
- **HUD sprite-resolution fallback (e5ca177, `cl_dll/hud.cpp`)** — TS's `hud.txt` is 320/640-only; the
  modern client picks `m_iRes`=1280 at 2560-wide → matches nothing → no sprite HUD. `CHud::VidInit` now
  falls back to the largest res present. NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT: TS has a *fully custom* client HUD,
  so there is still NO HUD at all (no health/ammo/crosshair) — that's Phase 4 below.
- **Reload (241ba55, `dlls/ts_gun.cpp` + weapon table)** — root cause of "fire til empty, no reload": the
  stock `CBasePlayerWeapon::ItemPostFrame` gates reload on the player's standard `m_rgAmmo`, which TS never
  populates (ammo is in `CTSGun::m_ammoReserve` per caliber). Added `CTSGun::ItemPostFrame` that drives the
  TS ammo system: reload on `+reload` or auto when the clip runs dry, refill from the per-caliber reserve
  after `TS_RELOAD_TIME`, plays the per-weapon `reload` viewmodel sequence (`iReloadAnim`, parsed from each
  `v_*.mdl`). Built clean, runs in xash without crash (awaiting user playtest confirmation).

**User mandate: reconstruct the player/weapon/input/HUD systems WHOLESALE from the decomp** (stop the
symptom-patching). The 5-phase plan is tracked as tasks #6–#10 and in HANDOFF "Track B playtest
reconstruction": (1) weapon firing/reload/ammo/fire-rate [reload done], (2) CBasePlayer thinks/state + the
low-pitch fire sound (suspect slow-motion time-scale), (3) all TS commands/cvars/+toggles server+client,
(4) the TS client HUD (why there's no HUD), (5) client view bob/sway + predicted fire events.

**Open playtest reports (unfixed):** no HUD at all (Phase 4), regular fire sound is LOW-PITCHED ("slow-mo",
Phase 2 — confirmed pitch not the file: `beretta/fire.wav` is normal 22kHz), akimbo fire SOUND missing
(`g_weaponInfo[8].pszFireSound` is null — akimbo should fall back to the single's sound; quick Phase-1
fix), viewmodel bob "snap" (user confirmed `cl_bob 0` stops it; Phase 5), fire-rate feels ungated (Phase 1).

**Docs synced (this entry):** CLAUDE.md (compat-target rewrite + a Running/testing section: xash run loop,
`pgrep -x xash3d` not `pkill -f`, GPU-present), HANDOFF.md (compat target + the 5-phase plan + cont.47–50
status), RECONSTRUCTION.md (status rows). CLAUDE.md stays local-only (gitignored); the rest committed.

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 49) — TRACK B playtest pass: loadout, mouselook, fire animations (decomp-driven)

The user playtested the running client (cont.48) and reported HL leftovers. Fixed three, each
decomp-grounded (the user explicitly asked to check the decomp, not guess). The dev box launches the
game for the user via `setsid env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./xash3d -game ts +map tm_avana &` (kill the old one
with `pgrep -x xash3d` — NOT `pkill -f client-x64/xash3d`, which matches the shell's own cmdline and
SIGTERMs your session). A detached/unfocused instance exits clean (~exit 0) after a bit; it stays up while
the user interacts.

1. **Spawn loadout (commit 54dac48, `dlls/ts_teams.cpp`).** Players spawned with HL crowbar+glock because
   `CTSGameRules::PlayerSpawn` chained `CHalfLifeMultiplay::PlayerSpawn`. Decompiled the real
   `CHalfLifeMultiplay::PlayerSpawn @0x790ac`: it honours `game_player_equip`, else
   `GiveNamedItem("weapon_tsgun")` (PIC strings resolved via GOT-0x6dda6) + `BuyArmament()` (cont.36).
   Reconstructed exactly → no HL weapons; spawn gives the unified TS gun (default `m_weaponType` =
   TSW_BERETTA, so you get a beretta) + the armament. (`CHalfLifeMultiplay::PlayerSpawn` itself is an
   11-byte forwarder to FUN_000890b8; `CBasePlayer::TSInit @0x92a4c` inits CTSAnimation/CTSStunt +
   `SetPlayerSpeed(330)`, gives no weapons.)
2. **Mouselook (commit + `cl_dll/inputw32.cpp`).** "Can't look up/down, only side-to-side; moving jolts
   the view fwd/back" = mouse-look OFF (mouse-Y walks you instead of pitching). The rig config never
   issues `+mlook`; TS is always-mouselook. Forced `in_mlook.state |= 1` in `IN_Init`. User CONFIRMED
   fixed. (Note: the *viewmodel* jolting back-and-forth is SEPARATE — still open; it's the client view
   bob/lag/sway, `cl_bob "3"` in the TS config + stock V_CalcBob/V_CalcViewModelLag — needs the client
   view reconstruction.)
3. **Fire animations (commit c607b75, `dlls/ts_weapons.{h,cpp}` + `ts_gun.cpp`).** Weapons fired
   (bullets/sound/muzzleflash already present) but the viewmodel never animated. Added `iFireAnim` to
   `s_weapon_info`, populated per-weapon from the actual "shoot*" sequence index parsed out of each
   `v_*.mdl` (studiohdr numseq/seqindex at offsets 164/168; 176-byte seqdesc; beretta shoot=1, glock=3,
   m4=3, aug=2, shotguns shootsemi=6, …; -1 for melee/grenade/akimbo). `StandardFire` now
   `SendWeaponAnim(wi->iFireAnim)`. SLICE: server-driven (visible, not predicted).

**Firing event system — fully MAPPED from the decomp (the faithful follow-up, task #6).** `CTSGun`
precaches 11 events (`events/fire.sc` → `m_usFire` @0x964, +coldcock@0x966/pump@0x96a/closecombat@0x96c/
firelinked@0x96e/reload@0x970/knife@0x972/katana@0x974/draw@0x976/grenade@0x978/empty@0x968). `StandardFire
@0x824a4` plays it: `PLAYBACK_EVENT(flags=1, player_pev, m_usFire, delay=0, vecZero, vecZero, fparam1=spread,
fparam2=spread, iparam1=m_weaponType(0xc8), iparam2=item+0x10, bparam1=(clip==0), bparam2=player[0x1fb])`.
The faithful client side = hook `events/fire.sc` → `EV_TSFire` reading iparam1=weapontype → predicted
sound + viewmodel anim + muzzleflash. NOT yet built (needs the client.dll EV callback). Our current sound
is a server EMIT_SOUND of `weapons/<w>/fire.wav` (22kHz, correct format); the user's "slow-mo sound"
report is unresolved (headless = no audio) — clarify low-pitch vs wrong-file vs droning.

**Still open (Track B client reconstruction):** the viewmodel jolt/bob, the predicted fire event (sound+
anim), the akimbo/melee/grenade fire anims, and the HL weapon-select HUD bar.

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 48) — TRACK B: the client RUNS + RENDERS in xash3d-fwgs; round-time HUD VISUALLY VERIFIED

**Headline: the dev box is NOT headless — it has a real GPU + X display (AMD RX 9070 XT, DISPLAY=:0).**
The cont.46 "headless, build-only, visual needs the user" caveat was WRONG. mod-ts client work can be
**self-verified with screenshots here** (`import -window root`). This changes the Track B workflow:
build → run in native xash3d-fwgs → screenshot → confirm. Use it.

**Done — mod-ts now runs end-to-end in native xash3d-fwgs (server + OUR client + content), and the
cont.47 round-time HUD is confirmed on-screen: a yellow `1:51` M:SS countdown at top-centre.**

1. **`scripts/setup-xash-mod.sh` (new) — the deliverable** ("configure xash to run this mod"). Assembles a
   native game root at `xash3d-fwgs/dist/client-x64` (which already holds the built engine: xash3d +
   libxash + libref_gl + libmenu + filesystem_stdio + libvgui). It builds `ts/` (content symlinks to
   `~/Containers/hlds/mods/ts`, our libs, a direct-gamedll liblist.gam — no metamod), completes the
   `valve/` fallback, and exposes the openvgui lib as `vgui.so`. **Three gotchas it encodes:**
   - xash on **x86-64 looks up the ARCH-SUFFIXED name** `hl_amd64.so` / `client_amd64.so` (the
     `COM_GenerateServerLibraryPath` `#else` branch — `XASH_X86` is 32-bit only). Misnamed `hl.so` was
     SILENTLY skipped → it loaded `valve/dlls/hl_amd64.so` instead (symptom: `No spawn function for
     "ts_hack"/"ts_sellzone"/...` for the LATER-added TS entities while older ones worked). Fix: name our
     libs `*_amd64.so` (bare name kept as an alias).
   - the cont.46 client links `DT_NEEDED vgui.so`; the engine ships the identical openvgui as
     `libvgui.so` (byte-for-byte = mod-ts/linux/release/vgui64.so) → symlink `vgui.so -> libvgui.so` and
     launch with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.`. libSDL2 resolves from the system.
   - Launch: `cd dist/client-x64 && LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./xash3d -dev 2 -game ts +map tm_avana`.
2. **Client crash fix (commit f484842) — `cl_dll/com_weapons.{cpp,h}` + `cl_dll/hl/hl_weapons.cpp`.**
   First actual RUN of the client SIGSEGV'd (user caught the "Xash Error: signal 11" dialog). gdb
   backtrace: `HUD_PostRunCmd → HUD_InitClientWeapons → HUD_PrepEntity → CGlock::Spawn → 0x0`. Pinned the
   exact insn (`call *g_engfuncs+536` right after loading the "weapon_9mmhandgun" string): on **64-bit**,
   `MAKE_STRING()` = `ALLOC_STRING()` = `(*g_engfuncs.pfnAllocString)` (util.h `#if __x86_64__`), but
   `HUD_InitClientWeapons` populates only a SUBSET of `g_engfuncs` and never sets `pfnAllocString` → the
   first `MAKE_STRING()` in any predicted weapon's Spawn deref'd NULL. Fix: a small client string pool +
   `stub_AllocString`/`stub_StringBase` (com_weapons), with `gpGlobals->pStringBase` pointed at the pool
   in HUD_InitClientWeapons so MAKE_STRING/STRING stay consistent (offset 0 reserved as ""). This is a
   generic halflife-updated 64-bit client-prediction bug, not TS-specific.
3. **Round-time-on-join (commit fd5146a) — `dlls/ts_gamerules.{h,cpp}` + `ts_teams.cpp`.** `StartRoundTimer`
   only broadcasts `RoundTime` at arm-time, so a client joining mid-round saw a blank HUD. Added
   `CTSGameRules::SendRoundTime(player)`, called from `InitHUD`, to catch a joiner up (no-op if unarmed).

**Verified (RUNTIME + VISUAL):** `setup-xash-mod.sh` → `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./xash3d -game ts +map tm_avana`
→ strace confirms it loads OUR `ts/dlls/hl_amd64.so` + `ts/cl_dlls/client_amd64.so`; gdb-clean for a full
35s session (only SIGINT, no SIGSEGV); screenshot shows the world rendering (viewmodel, map) + the
**yellow `1:51` round clock** top-centre, window titled "mod-ts (faithful reconstruction)". The round
timer armed (counting from 120s) and the client read+drew the message. Server-side regression: tm_avana +
ts_dust2 load with 0 "No spawn function" once the dll name was fixed.

**Next Track B slices (now screenshot-verifiable):** the powerup/motion-blur indicators
(`TSPowerUpTime`/`TSMBlur` — verify names vs the .so first), the ammo/fire-mode HUDs, then the visible
slow-motion time-dilation + the particle system. Also noted but deferred: the stock client logs
`Unknown command cl_realhud / hud_r/g/b/color / mp_teammodels` — TS client cvars the original defined,
not yet reconstructed (harmless). The bg game process exits cleanly (exit 0) after a bit when launched
detached/unfocused — not a crash; interactive runs stay up.

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 47) — TRACK B: first TS client HUD — the round-time countdown (CHudRoundTime)

**Done — the first piece of TS client code: `cl_dll/roundtime.{cpp,h}` (CHudRoundTime).** The round-time
countdown HUD, reading the message the server already sends (cont.45). This is the first TS reader in
the cl_dll — proves the Track B loop (server sends a user message → client HUD element hooks + reads +
draws) end to end at build/load level.

**Fidelity fix to the server first (`dlls/ts_gamerules.cpp`):** the original `ts_i386.so` registers the
round-time user message as the string **`"RoundTime"`** (the C++ global is named `gmsgTSRoundTime` — both
appear in the unstripped symtab/.rodata; the registered STRING is "RoundTime", confirmed at .so .rodata
0x95900 where client.dll also hooks it). The inherited cont.45 server registered `"TSRoundTime"` — a
fidelity bug (client.dll hooks "RoundTime"). Changed `REG_USER_MSG("TSRoundTime")` → `REG_USER_MSG("RoundTime")`;
kept the var name `gmsgTSRoundTime` (faithful). Wire format unchanged: two shorts — `WRITE_SHORT(seconds
remaining, rounded)` + `WRITE_SHORT(0)` (the second is a flag word, 0 in the shipped binary; matches the
original `RestartRound` send @ the .so).

**Client element (mirrors the stock CHudBattery/Health pattern):**
- `CHudRoundTime : CHudBase` — `Init` hooks the `RoundTime` message (`HOOK_MESSAGE(RoundTime)`) + adds
  itself to the HUD list; `MsgFunc_RoundTime` reads the two shorts, turns `seconds` into an absolute
  client-time expiry (`m_flEndTime = gHUD.m_flTime + seconds`) so the clock keeps ticking locally between
  server updates (seconds<=0 clears it + drops HUD_ACTIVE); `Draw` renders `M:SS` (sprintf `%d:%02d`)
  centred just below the top of the screen via `DrawHudString` + `GetConsoleStringSize`, yellowish
  (RGB_YELLOWISH), flashing red (RGB_REDISH) in the last 10s; `Reset` clears it.
- Wired in: `cl_dll/hud.h` (`#include "roundtime.h"` + `CHudRoundTime m_RoundTime;`), `cl_dll/hud.cpp`
  (`m_RoundTime.Init()` + `.VidInit()`), `cl_dll/CMakeLists.txt` (`roundtime.cpp` in the source list).

**Verified (BUILD + LOAD-level, per the cont.46 caveat — this headless box can't RENDER the client):**
- `build.sh amd64 client` → 64-bit client.so (openvgui), glibc floor 2.14; `build.sh i386 client` →
  32-bit client.so (Valve vgui), glibc floor 2.3 — both clean. `nm | c++filt` shows the linked
  `CHudRoundTime::{Init,VidInit,Draw,Reset,MsgFunc_RoundTime}`; `strings client.so` shows the `RoundTime`
  hook string.
- `build.sh amd64` (server) → hl.so clean; `strings hl.so` shows `RoundTime` (not TSRoundTime).
- Server no-regression: booted `tm_avana` on the rig (our hl.so) → GAME SKILL LEVEL reached, 0 Can't init,
  no crash over 20s. (The message rename is server-string-only; doesn't touch the verified cont.45 timer
  logic.)

**VISUAL CONFIRMATION STILL OWED (coordinate with the user):** the actual on-screen M:SS clock needs a
graphical GoldSrc/xash client run by the user — build/load here can't show pixels. The likely visual
tweaks once seen: exact screen position/size, whether TS draws it as a clock sprite vs. text, and the
flash threshold. Treat position/colour as // VERIFY.

**Next Track B slices** (all read messages the server already sends): the powerup/motion-blur indicators
(`gmsgTSPowerUpTime` / `gmsgTSMotionBlur` — the .so registers `TSMBlur`, `TSSlowMo`, `TSState`, `TSHealth`,
`TSArmor`, `TSCash`, `TSFrags`, `TSBTime`, `TSPSys` — CHECK each inherited gmsg name against the .so
strings the same way RoundTime was fixed), then the bigger visible-slow-motion time-dilation (client
pmove scales frametime by the slow fields) and the particle system (CTSSharedEmitter/CTSEmitter/CTSParticle
via the `TSPSys` message).

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 46) — TRACK B START: the client (cl_dll) now builds, both 32-bit + 64-bit

**Done — the cl_dll build foundation.** The mod-ts client library (`cl_dll/` → `client.so`) now
builds in the buildchain for BOTH i386 and amd64. This is the prerequisite for ALL Track B (TS client
HUDs, visible slow-motion, particles, stunts) — none of which could start before the client built.

**Key finding (answers "how did halflife-updated link vgui for 64-bit?"):** it never did. `build.sh`
only ever built `--target hl` (the server); NO `client.so` exists anywhere in halflife-updated's build
tree. The bundled `vgui.so`/`libSDL2` were always 32-bit; the 32-bit-VGUI wall was simply never hit
because nobody built the client target in the 64-bit buildchain. Track B is the first time.

Three portability fixes (committed 8f3b248) to compile the stock client under the buildchain's gcc-8.3:
- `cl_dll/particleman/CMiniMem.h`: replaced `std::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource` (<memory_resource>,
  gcc-9+) with a minimal `operator new`-backed pool shim (same allocate/deallocate/release surface).
- `cl_dll/particleman/CFrustum.cpp`: dropped `<GL/gl.h>` (absent in buildchain) — it only needs the
  GL_MODELVIEW_MATRIX/GL_PROJECTION_MATRIX enum values for the engine TriAPI; defined locally.
- `cl_dll/entity.cpp`: `(int)pTemp` (FTENT_SPIRAL phase) is a 64-bit-pointer→int truncation → route
  through intptr_t.

Dual-arch VGUI (this commit), per the user's pointer to xash3d-fwgs:
- **32-bit** (i386) links Valve's bundled `vgui.so` (Steam HL); **64-bit** (amd64) links openvgui's
  ABI-compatible `libvgui.so` — vendored as `linux/release/vgui64.so` (from xash3d-fwgs, x86-64), plus
  a 64-bit `libSDL2` vendored as `linux/libSDL2-2.0-x64.so.0`. openvgui is a drop-in: the client
  compiles against the STOCK `../utils/vgui/include` headers and links clean against it (no source
  changes — just a relink). Both are only load-time linked (the engine supplies the real libs).
- `cl_dll/CMakeLists.txt`: selects the arch-appropriate vgui/SDL2 by `CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P`; build-dir
  filenames stay `vgui.so`/`libSDL2-2.0.so.0` so DT_NEEDED is uniform (the runtime provides the
  arch-correct lib under that name). `scripts/build.sh` gained a target arg: `build.sh <arch> [hl|
  client|all]` (default hl, backward-compatible). `linux/.gitignore` allows the two new vendored libs.

**Verified (BUILD-ONLY):** `build.sh amd64 client` → 64-bit client.so (openvgui), glibc floor 2.14;
`build.sh i386 client` → 32-bit client.so (Valve vgui), glibc floor 2.3; `build.sh amd64` still builds
the server (backward compat); `build.sh amd64 all` builds both. DT_NEEDED = vgui.so + libSDL2-2.0.so.0
for both arches.

**VERIFICATION GAP (important for Track B):** this headless box can BUILD client.so but cannot RENDER
it — the dedicated-server rig has no graphics, and the browser-playable client is the separate WASM
xash build, not this native client.so. So TS client work is build-verified here; visual/runtime
behaviour needs a graphical GoldSrc/xash client run by the user. Next Track B slice: a first TS HUD
(e.g. the round-time countdown reading gmsgTSRoundTime) — build + load verifiable, visual by the user.

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 45) — Round timer (CTSGameRules::RoundTimeLeft + StartRoundTimer)

**Done — the team-round time limit.** Completes the round lifecycle: team rounds now end three ways —
elimination (cont.37), objective (cont.25/31), and now TIME-OUT. Part of Track A's round polish.

RE (recovered/server/CTSGameRules.c): RestartRound @0x77920 sets the round end time +8 =
clamp(`roundtime` cvar, 30, 180) + time, clears +0xc..0xf, and (if the round-time flag +0x10)
sends gmsgTSRoundTime (remaining seconds). RoundTimeLeft @0x79024: when +8 elapses, fire the objective
manager's `targetontimeleft` (+0x554 → +0x94) then `TeamWin(2)` = a DRAW. Functional reconstruction:
- `CTSGameRules::StartRoundTimer()`: m_flRoundEnd = time + clamp(TS_ROUNDTIME=120, 30, 180) + register
  & send gmsgTSRoundTime (remaining seconds) to all (lazy REG_USER_MSG "TSRoundTime").
- `CTSGameRules::RoundTimeLeft()`: `TSFireTimeLeftTarget()` (new free helper in ts_objectives.cpp —
  fires the objective manager's m_targetTimeLeft) + `TeamWin(2)` (draw → schedules the round restart).
- `Think`: in team mode with no win pending, arm the timer on the first frame (m_flRoundEnd==0 →
  StartRoundTimer) and run RoundTimeLeft when it expires. `TSRestartRound` zeroes m_flRoundEnd so the
  next round re-arms.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, tm_avana, temp probe reverted — shortened the timer to 4s):** full cycle
armed(4s) → expired → RoundTimeLeft draw (score [0,0] UNCHANGED = correct, a draw doesn't score) →
restart scheduled (+3s) → respawn → timer re-armed → … cycling cleanly. No crash; clean regression
(tm_avana + ctb_deadheat 0 Can't init, ts_wyndham only ts_emitter/ts_particle). (Ran on -port 27018.)

**SLICE:** TS_ROUNDTIME is a fixed 120s (the .so reads a `roundtime` cvar — VERIFY/wire it); the
round-time-enabled flag is implied by team mode (no per-mode gate); gmsgTSRoundTime is sent but no
cl_dll reads it (no round-time HUD). This leaves UpdateTeamScores/InitTeamScore + the full faithful
RestartRound (game-mode member + per-player round setup) + ShowObjectiveOnHud as the last Track A
polish; the big frontier is Track B (cl_dll).

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 44) — CTSPlayerAmount + CTSSuperJump (small self-contained leftovers)

**Done — `dlls/ts_playeramount.cpp` (CTSPlayerAmount) + `CTSSuperJump` in `dlls/ts_powerup.cpp`.**
Two of the small non-FGD-table leftovers; both self-contained, synthetic-verified.

RE: `CTSPlayerAmount` (Spawn @0x72a78, ClientConnect @0x72aec / ClientDisconnect) is a point relay
(ts_playeramount) — a per-entity counter (+0x6c) that fires `connecttarget` (+0x74) when the count
rises to `clients` (+0x70) and `disconnecttarget` (+0xd8) when it falls back to it, driven off the
engine connect/disconnect events. `CTSSuperJump` (Spawn @0xc9f44) is `CTSSuperJump : CTSPowerUp` —
sets m_iType = 0x100 (TS_PWUP_LOWGRAV) then chains CTSPowerUp::Spawn, so it's a map powerup that
always gives the super-jump (low-gravity) effect. Reconstruction:
- `CTSPlayerAmount : CBaseEntity` — KeyValue clients/connecttarget/disconnecttarget; a 0.5s CountThink
  polls the live connected-player count and fires connecttarget on the rising edge to `clients` /
  disconnecttarget on the falling edge (a poll equivalent of the .so's connect/disconnect events, so
  no engine hook needed).
- `CTSSuperJump : CTSPowerUp` — Spawn forces m_iType = TS_PWUP_LOWGRAV then CTSPowerUp::Spawn.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, SYNTHETIC — temp probe reverted):** a ts_playeramount(clients=2)
fired connecttarget the moment the live count rose to 2 (rising-edge); ts_superjump spawned as a
powerup without crashing. Clean regression (tm_avana 0 Can't init; ts_theatre's 328 powerups still 0
Can't init — CTSSuperJump didn't disturb the powerup path). (Ran on -port 27018; 27015 held by an
unrelated app.)

**SLICE:** CTSPlayerAmount uses a poll instead of the engine connect/disconnect hooks + ignores its
spawnflags; CTSSuperJump inherits CTSPowerUp's Save/Restore as-is. Remaining leftovers: CInfoBreakable
(a respawning breakable — thin, deferred), CBulletManager (the traveling-bullet/bullet-time system —
deferred: it rewrites the verified instant-hitscan fire path + isn't visible without a cl_dll).

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 43) — CTSScoreGiver + CVipEscape (the last team-objective leftovers)

**Done — `CTSScoreGiver` + `CVipEscape` in `dlls/ts_objectives.cpp`.** The two small remaining
team-objective entities; closes out the Track A entity list. Both FGD-listed, 0 stock placements →
synthetic-verified.

RE: `CTSScoreGiver` (Spawn @0x8c0b8, Use @0x8c158) is `@PointClass base(WinGiver)` — identical to
CTSWinGiver (cont.25) but its Use RESETS the call counter after firing (param+0x19 = 0) so it scores
REPEATEDLY (vs WinGiver latching done), and a "Respawn Players" spawnflag. `CVipEscape` (Spawn
@0x8d23c) is classname **`func_vip_safetyzone`** (not ts_vipescape) — a passive brush marker (KeyValue
stub, empty Precache, non-solid SET_MODEL) the unbuilt VIP-escort logic checks against; it has no
touch/use of its own. Reconstruction:
- `CTSScoreGiver : CTSWinGiver` — Use counts to callsnumber, then bumps `CTSGameRules::m_teamScore`
  + HUD message + re-arms (m_calls=0). Scores DIRECTLY (not via TeamWin) so it's genuinely repeatable
  and doesn't restart the round (a score giver gives points without ending the round, unlike the win
  giver). // SLICE: the .so routes through TeamWin w/ cash; "Respawn Players" spawnflag not applied.
- `CVipEscape : CBaseEntity` (func_vip_safetyzone) — a non-solid brush marker. // SLICE: the VIP win
  detection is in the unbuilt team subsystem.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, tm_avana, SYNTHETIC — temp probe reverted):** ts_scoregiver callsnumber=2:
team0 score 0 → 0 (1 call) → 1 (2 calls = scored) → 2 (4 calls = re-armed + scored again, REPEATABLE,
no round-restart block); func_vip_safetyzone created without crash. Clean regression (tm_avana +
ctb_deadheat + ts_dust2 0 Can't init). (Ran on -port 27018; 27015 held by an unrelated app.)

**TRACK A ENTITY LIST COMPLETE.** All FGD team/CTF/objective entities are now reconstructed: teams
(cont.35) + cash/buy (36) + elimination (37) + CTSFlag (38) + CTSBriefcase (39) + CTSBomb (40) +
CTSSellZone (41) + CTSTeamEscape (42) + CTSScoreGiver/CVipEscape (43). Remaining Track A polish is
faithful niceties (UpdateTeamScores/InitTeamScore, the round timer, ShowObjectiveOnHud, CheckDeads
grace/CTB/last-man, capture-via-TeamWin-restarts-round). The big remaining frontier is **Track B —
the cl_dll** (visible slow-motion, the particle system CTSSharedEmitter/CTSEmitter/CTSParticle,
CTSStunt, all HUDs) — NONE built yet. Also the small non-FGD leftovers: CTSPlayerAmount,
CTSSuperJump, CInfoBreakable, CBulletManager.

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 42) — CTSTeamEscape (team escort/escape zone)

**Done — `dlls/ts_escape.cpp` (ts_teamescape).** A team escort objective: when enough of the
attacker team is simultaneously inside the zone, it completes (fire target + HUD message). FGD-backed
(`@SolidClass`, brush, base tsobjective); 0 stock placements → synthetic-verified.

RE (recovered/escape/CTSTeamEscape.c): Spawn @0x8d390 (brush SET_MODEL + SetSize), EnableObjective
@0x8d4a0 (enable + clear the 33-slot presence array + count), WaitTouch @0x8d4ec (attacker-team
player → track by entindex, count distinct; threshold from escapepercentage @+0xf4 over the attacker
TEAM SIZE: 0→1, 1→size/3, 2→2*size/3, 3→size; complete → FireTargets+HUD+EnableObjective(false)),
WaitThink @0x8d6b0 (clear the presence array + count every 1s — so it counts SIMULTANEOUS presence).
Functional reconstruction onto the stock SDK (inlined attacker-team gate like ts_objectives.cpp; team
size = live attacker-team players):
- `CTSTeamEscape : CBaseEntity` (brush SOLID_TRIGGER). m_present[33] (EHANDLE by entindex) + m_count.
- WaitTouch accumulates distinct attacker-team touchers; threshold per escapepercentage switch;
  completion fires target + message + disables. WaitThink resets the window each second.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, tm_avana, SYNTHETIC — temp probe reverted):** team size 2 — escapepercentage
0 (one member): one touch → completed (enabled=0); escapepercentage 3 (all): one touch stays active
(enabled=1), all touches → completed (enabled=0). No crash; clean regression (tm_avana + ts_dust2 0
Can't init). (Ran on -port 27018; 27015 still held by an unrelated app.)

**SLICE:** enable is faithfully gamerules-driven (here Spawn); no Save/Restore (the .so has
m_SaveData); completion fires the target only (no team score / round-win — that's the objective
manager's job); team size = live players (the .so reads the team struct via TSCountPlayers).

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 41) — CTSSellZone (sell dropped weapons for cash) + a powerup-precache fix

**Done — `dlls/ts_sellzone.cpp` (ts_sellzone).** The one entity that makes the cont.36 cash actually
flow: a brush zone that sells dropped weapons. FGD-backed (`@SolidClass`, base tsobjective; ts_dust2
places one).

RE (recovered/sellzone/CTSSellZone.c): KeyValue @0x726c0 (attackerteam), Spawn @0x72720 (brush
SET_MODEL + SetSize + SetTouch), SellTouch @0x727e8 — a ~61-byte NEAR-STUB that only does
`strcmp(toucher->classname, "WorldGun")`. Consistent with cont.36 (CashBased OFF → the sell economy
is vestigial in the shipped binary). Functional reconstruction:
- `CTSSellZone : CBaseEntity` (brush SOLID_TRIGGER). SellTouch: a touching `ts_worldgun` (a dropped
  weapon, cont.27) → credit the nearest living player (on the zone's team, if set) a flat
  SELLZONE_VALUE ($500) via `CBasePlayer::GiveCash` + a center-print, then UTIL_Remove the gun.

**Also fixed a pre-existing latent crash (surfaced by ts_dust2):** the dynamic DM powerup spawner
(cont.26 PutPowerUp → CTSPowerUp::Spawn) PRECACHE_MODELs `models/powerup.mdl` at RUNTIME — fine on
maps with ts_powerup placements (precached at load), but Host_Errors on a DM map with none (ts_dust2:
no ts_powerup, no objective_manager → DM → spawner runs → crash). Added `models/powerup.mdl` to
PrecacheAllTSWeapons (map load), same fix pattern as cont.38/40.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_dust2 — a REAL map with a sell zone, temp probe reverted):** the zone
spawns (0 Can't init, was 1 + the powerup crash gone); a dropped beretta worldgun dropped at a player
→ SellTouch credited the player cash 0→500 + marked the gun removed (FL_KILLME). No crash; clean
regression (ts_dust2 + tm_avana + ctb_deadheat all 0 Can't init).

**SLICE:** flat sale value (the per-weapon price s_weapon_info+0xd8 isn't extracted + is dead while
CashBased off); the dropped gun records no seller (no pev->owner) so the nearest player is credited;
no team-score / round effect.

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 40) — CTSBomb: the defuse / wire-cut objective

**Done — `dlls/ts_bomb.cpp` (ts_bomb).** A self-contained team objective: a planted bomb that counts
down and explodes unless defused. FGD-backed (`@SolidClass`, base tsobjective). 0 stock placements →
synthetic-verified (like ts_dmhill cont.32 / ts_trigger cont.34).

RE (recovered/bomb/CTSBomb.c): Spawn @0x8c470, Precache @0x8c570 (misc/beep2.wav), SetRandomWires
@0x8c598 (3 wires: one DEFUSE(1), one BOOBYTRAP(2), rest NEUTRAL(3)), EnableObjective @0x8c608 (arm/
safe), CutWire @0x8c70c (1→defuse+fire target/msg, 2→fast countdown, 3→timer to 0 = detonate),
WaitThink @0x8c860 (−1/tick, 1s or 0.1s when fast, beep rising pitch, detonate at 0 = TSExplosion),
Use @0x8c9a4 (hold USE `defusetime`s → defuse, FCAP_CONTINUOUS_USE=0x10), KeyValue defusetime/cutwires.
Functional reconstruction onto the stock SDK:
- `CTSBomb : CBaseEntity` (brush, inlined attackerteam gate like ts_objectives.cpp). Arms on Spawn
  (SLICE: faithful enable is gamerules InitObjectives). EnableObjective(true)=arm+SetRandomWires+
  WaitThink; (false)=safe.
- WaitThink: countdown −1/tick (1s, or 0.1s after a boobytrap), beep, `Explode` at 0 via
  `ExplosionCreate` (the SDK env_explosion blast — assets already precached by the weapon/grenade path).
- CutWire(0..2): defuse → FireTargets(target)+HUD msg+safe; boobytrap → m_bFast; neutral → timer≈0
  (next WaitThink detonates). `tscutwire <n>` console command (cl_dll wire UI is a SLICE).
- Use: continuous-USE accumulator over defusetime → defuse (FireTargets+msg).
- misc/beep2.wav added to PrecacheAllTSWeapons (map load) — a runtime-armed bomb's PRECACHE_SOUND
  Host_Errors (gdb/log-caught, same class as cont.38); dropped the Spawn-time Precache() call.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, tm_avana, SYNTHETIC — temp probe reverted):** armed bomb wires=[2 1 3]
(one each); cut DEFUSE wire → enabled=0 (defused); cut NEUTRAL wire → timer 0.01 → WaitThink Explode
(ExplosionCreate runs at runtime, enabled=0, no crash); cut BOOBYTRAP wire → fast=1 still armed. No
crash; clean regression (tm_avana + ctb_deadheat 0 Can't init, ts_wyndham only ts_emitter/ts_particle).
(Test ran on -port 27018; 27015 was held by an unrelated app.)

**SLICE:** bomb countdown is a fixed 45s (the .so reads a bomb-time global DAT_001781a8 — VERIFY);
faithful arm is gamerules-driven (here Spawn); wire-cut needs the cl_dll UI (console-driven); no
Save/Restore (the .so has CTSBomb m_SaveData); detonation doesn't end the round / score (just blasts).

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 39) — CTSBriefcase: the CTF base/capture zone (seeds CTSFlag on a real map)

**Done — `dlls/ts_briefcase.cpp` (ts_briefcase).** The map-placed CTF objective that pairs with the
cont.38 CTSFlag: each team's briefcase seeds its flag at base and is the capture zone. Replaces
cont.38's `tsspawnflag` console stand-in — **first CTF entity verified on a real stock map**
(ctb_deadheat). FGD-backed `@SolidClass` (brush), ownerteam 1..4.

RE (recovered/briefcase/CTSBriefcase.c): ctor @0x8d788 (per-briefcase flag id s_nextFlagID 1..15,
team @+0x68 = -1, s_flag_status @+0x90), KeyValue @0x8d7f4 (contents/message/ownerteam), Spawn
@0x8d88c (brush SET_MODEL + SetSize), FlagFall @0x8da00 (CreateFlag(0, &s_flag_status) at the brush
centre + gmsgTSHaveFlag HUD + WaitThink), CanInteract @0x8db48 (team @+0x68 == player team),
CaptureTouch @0x8db9c (a living HaveFlag player who CanInteract → capture the carried flag).
Functional reconstruction onto the cont.38 CTSFlag:
- `CTSBriefcase : CBaseEntity` (brush SOLID_TRIGGER). KeyValue ownerteam is **1-based** in the FGD →
  stored 0-based (`m_iOwnerTeam = atoi-1`) to match pev->team / the objective gating; + contents +
  message (capture announce).
- Spawn: brush model + SOLID_TRIGGER; SetTouch(CaptureTouch); SetThink(FlagFall) @+0.5s.
- FlagFall: `TSCreateFlag(m_iOwnerTeam, Center())` — seeds this team's carriable flag at base (delayed
  so the runtime SET_MODEL follows the precache pass), then idle WaitThink.
- CaptureTouch: a living player carrying a flag (`TSPlayerHasFlag`) at THEIR own briefcase
  (`CanInteract`) → `TSReturnCarriedFlag` (return the carried flag) + `TeamWin(team)` + announce
  pev->message. (New shared helpers `TSPlayerHasFlag`/`TSReturnCarriedFlag` added to ts_flag.cpp.)

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ctb_deadheat — a REAL stock CTB map, temp probe reverted):** 2 briefcases
spawn (0 Can't init, was 2), each FlagFall-seeds its flag at base with the correct 0-based team —
team 0 (Specialists) @(128 2048 192) + team 1 (Mercenaries) @(-128 -2048 192) (FGD ownerteam 1/2 →
0/1). Capture reuses the cont.38-verified TSReturnCarriedFlag + TeamWin. No crash; clean regression
(ctb_deadheat + tm_avana 0 Can't init, ts_wyndham only the known ts_emitter/ts_particle).

**SLICE:** the per-flag network id + gmsgTSHaveFlag HUD is server-only (no cl_dll flag indicator);
capture scores via TeamWin (which restarts the round — faithfully a capture awards cash + a HUD
without ending the round); no s_flag_status / contents drop; Save/Restore not wired (FCAP_DONT_SAVE).

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 38) — CTSFlag: the CTF flag (carry / capture / drop), unblocked by teams

**Done — `dlls/ts_flag.cpp` (ts_flag).** The first CTF entity, now possible because team
assignment (cont.35) gives a real pev->team. The classic capture-the-flag loop, gated on team.

RE (recovered/flag/CTSFlag.c): `CTSFlag : CTSPhysicObject`, model `briefcase.mdl`, runtime-created
(CreateFlag @0x9d874 — NOT map-placed: no FGD entity, 0 BSP placements; the CTSBriefcase map
objective seeds the bases). m_iFlagTeam @+0x9c, carrier EHANDLE @+0xa4, s_flag_status (7 ints @+0x90)
mirrored onto the carrier (player+0x7d0) via CBasePlayer::TakeFlag @0x93830 / DropFlag @0x9334c +
GetSpeedBySlots (carrying slows you). CanInteract @0x9e2d4 = flag.team==-1 || ==player.team.
PlayerTakeFlag @0x9e330 (Use/WaitTouch): living player; own-team flag → capture/return branch, else
TakeFlag (grab). FUNCTIONAL reconstruction onto the stock SDK (no CTSPhysicObject, no speed-by-slots):
- `CTSFlag : CBaseEntity` with a team + a 3-state machine (AT_BASE / CARRIED / DROPPED).
- FlagTouch: an enemy/neutral flag + a non-carrying living player → AttachTo (carry: SOLID_NOT,
  CarryThink rides the carrier's back, follows + drops if the carrier dies/leaves). Own-team flag at
  base + you're carrying the enemy flag → CAPTURE (return the carried flag + score via TeamWin).
- DropAt (the PlayerKilled `TSDropFlag` hook + CarryThink-on-death): flag falls where the carrier
  died, SOLID_TRIGGER, ReturnThink auto-returns it to base after 30s. ReturnToBase resets it home.
- `CTSFlag::Create(team, base)` + free `TSCreateFlag`/`TSDropFlag`; a `tsspawnflag <team>` console
  command seeds bases (stand-in for the CTSBriefcase map objective). briefcase.mdl + the pickup/drop
  sounds added to PrecacheAllTSWeapons (map-load) — a runtime PRECACHE_MODEL Host_Errors (gdb-caught:
  PF_precache_model_I → Host_Error → ShutdownServer; same class of bug as cont.12).

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, tm_avana, SYNTHETIC — temp probe reverted):** seeded a spec(0) + merc(1)
flag at a merc bot; merc touches the spec flag → carried=1 state=CARRIED; merc (carrying) touches its
own merc flag at base → CAPTURE: spec flag returned to base (state=AT_BASE), team-1 score 0→1; re-grab
→ TSDropFlag → state=DROPPED, carrier cleared. No crash; clean regression (tm_avana 0 Can't init,
ts_wyndham only the known ts_emitter/ts_particle).

**SLICE:** carrying doesn't slow the carrier (no GetSpeedBySlots / s_flag_status); no CTSPhysicObject
bounce physics; capture scores via TeamWin's team score (which also schedules a round restart — the
faithful capture awards cash + a HUD pointer without ending the round); flags are console-seeded (the
map-placed CTSBriefcase that creates them isn't built); no flag HUD/carrier icon (cl_dll).

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 37) — CheckDeads: team-round elimination win condition

**Done — `CTSGameRules::CheckDeads`/`CallCheckDeads` (ts_gamerules.{h,cpp}).** The automatic team-
round win condition: a round ends + the surviving team wins when the other team is wiped out. Builds
on cont.31's TeamWin/round-restart + cont.35's team assignment — team mode now RESOLVES rounds on its
own (independent of the objective entities, which remain an alternate win path; both call TeamWin).

RE (recovered/server/CTSGameRules.c): CheckDeads @0x79c00 (1335 bytes), CallCheckDeads @0x79bc0.
CallCheckDeads: if no restart pending (+0xc==0) schedule CheckDeads at time+1 (+0x5880). CheckDeads
(team branch, game-mode 2/3): count alive players per team into local_3c[4] via GetTeamIndex(TeamID());
mode-3 (CTB) fires objective targets; else winner = the team with survivors — local_3c[1]<1 → team 0
wins, local_3c[0]>0 → return (contested), else team 1 wins; nobody alive → team 2 (draw); then
TeamWin(winner,0,1). Functional reconstruction:
- `CallCheckDeads()`: if `m_flRoundRestart==0 && m_flCheckDeads==0` → `m_flCheckDeads = time+1`.
- `CheckDeads()`: team mode + no restart pending; count alive/present per team (general over
  m_numTeams); require ≥2 players over ≥2 teams (so warmup/one-sided doesn't insta-win); `teamsAlive>=2`
  → return (contested); `==1` → TeamWin(lastAliveTeam); `0` → TeamWin(2)=draw.
- `Think`: fire CheckDeads when `m_flCheckDeads` elapses (before the restart check).
- `PlayerKilled`: `CallCheckDeads()` after the death loot.
- `TeamWin` refined: guard against a double-win in a round (`m_flRoundRestart!=0` → return); team 0/1
  bump m_teamScore + announce `GetIndexedTeamName`, anything else = a draw announce (no score).

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, tm_avana, temp probes reverted):** balanced 1v1 → force-killed the
Mercenary → 1s later CheckDeads (present[1,1] alive[1,0] teamsAlive=1) → TeamWin(0): Specialists
score [1,0], restart scheduled +3s → round restarted (respawn all + objectives re-armed) → next round
2v2 = contested (no premature win). No crash; clean regression (tm_avana 0 Can't init, ts_wyndham only
the known ts_emitter/ts_particle).

**SLICE:** no just-respawned grace window (the .so counts +0x770>=0 as still-alive; we use IsAlive());
mode-3 (CTB) objective-target firing not reconstructed (treated as plain elimination); no round timer
(gmsgTSRoundTime) or last-man-standing DM mode (g_lastManStanding branch); TeamWin still lacks the
faithful UpdateTeamScores/InitTeamScore + the full RestartRound@0x67920 (round timer + game-mode member).

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 36) — Cash + buy/armament system (free loadout; CashBased is OFF)

**Done — `dlls/ts_buy.cpp`: the TS cash + buy/armament loadout (Track A step 2).** Reuses the
built `GiveTSWeapon`/`TSAddAmmo` arsenal.

**KEY RE FINDING:** `CashBased__Fv` @0x66abc is hardcoded `return 0` in the shipped .so — the cash
economy is COMPILED OUT. Every `if (CashBased())` cost-deduction branch in BuyWeapon/BuyAmmo/AddItem
is dead, so the buy system gives weapons/ammo **FREE**. The real mechanic is a free ARMAMENT
(loadout) selector: the client menu queues weapons+ammo and `BuyArmament` applies them. Cash is
still tracked (the `cashforwin`/`cashforlose` cvars + a future sell zone) but never charged.

RE (recovered/buy/CBasePlayer.c): cash @+0x540 (clamped 0..30000, GiveCash @0x9310c); a pending
armament = ammo array @+0x554 (16 ints, rounds) + a weapon list @+0x594 (stride 0xc ×32: type/count/
gift). ResetArmament @0x93e88 (zeroes 0x70 ints), AddItemToArmament @0x93ea4 (first free slot),
AddAmmoToArmament @0x93ef4, BuyArmament @0x93f10 (each weapon → BuyWeapon or free AddItem; each
caliber → BuyAmmo), BuyAmmo @0x941e8, BuyWeapon @0x945bc (IsRestrictedWeapon @0x770c8 gate + the M61
special: type 0x18=24 is team-mode-only `1<TSGameRules` and capped 2/life via player+0x714, else free
PickUpWeapon). Functional reconstruction onto CBasePlayer + the cont.18 arsenal:
- `CashBased()` → false; `CBasePlayer::GiveCash` (clamped); members `m_iCash`/`m_iGrenadeBuys`/
  `m_armamentAmmo[16]`/`m_armament[32]` in player.h.
- `ResetArmament`/`AddItemToArmament`/`AddAmmoToArmament`/`BuyWeapon`/`BuyAmmo`/`BuyArmament`.
  `BuyWeapon` = M61 team-mode+cap-2 rule then free `GiveTSWeapon`; `BuyAmmo` = free `TSAddAmmo`.
- Console drivers in client.cpp (the faithful menu is cl_dll/`menuselect`, a SLICE): `tsbuy <type>`,
  `tsbuyammo <cal> <rounds>`, `tsarm <type> [count]`, `tsarmammo <cal> <rounds>`, `tsbuyarmament`,
  `tsresetarmament`.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, temp probe reverted):** tm_avana — queue {beretta(2),uzi(3)} + 50×9mm,
GiveCash(1000)→1000, BuyArmament → arsenal=2 [2,3], 9mm reserve filled to the cap 80; M61 ×3 → 1,1,0
(grenadeBuys cap 2). ts_wyndham (DM) — armament still applies free (arsenal=2), M61 ×3 → 0,0,0
(team-mode block). No crash; clean regression (only the known ts_emitter/ts_particle Can't-inits).

**SLICE/deferred:** weapons are free (faithful — CashBased off); the category-by-bitmask
`IsRestrictedWeapon` over CTSMapGlobals' restriction isn't wired (default 0x1f allows all → allow-all
stub is faithful for stock maps); no cl_dll buy menu (console-driven); armament ammo treated as rounds
(no per-caliber mag-size table); no starting cash / cash-for-win-lose award yet; price field
(s_weapon_info+0xd8) not extracted (dead while CashBased off).

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 35) — CTSGameRules team subsystem: team ASSIGNMENT (the keystone)

**Done — `dlls/ts_teams.cpp`: a real team layer on CTSGameRules + auto-balance assignment.**
First piece of Track A. Players now get a `pev->team`, which is what the already-built objective/CTF
gating reads (cont.25/34) — so team mode is no longer just inheriting MP.

RE (from the .so): the team subsystem is a packed 0x8c-byte per-team struct ×4 (cash @+0x1c, scores
@+0x20/+0x24, name @+0x28, spawn classnames @+0x68/+0x88, model list @+0x38), gated on the TS
game-mode byte @+0 (2/3 = a team map). InitTeams @0x77f60 builds "Specialists;Mercenaries"
(models "spec"/"merc") for a team map; GetTeamIndex @0x79b04 = case-insensitive name→index (0-based);
GetTeamsNum @0x785a8; GetPlayerModel @0x79a08 / GetTeamCash @0x79aac read the per-team struct. The
faithful trigger for a player landing on a team is the client class-selection menu (cl_dll, NOT built).

Functional reconstruction (modeled naturally, NOT transcribing the byte struct; mirrors the SDK
`CHalfLifeTeamplay` team half, which is the same logic):
- `CTSGameRules` keeps `m_szTeamList` + parallel `m_teamNames[]/m_teamModels[]` + `m_numTeams`.
- `IsTeamMode()` (cached tri-state `m_iTeamMode`): a `ts_objective_manager` is present (the same DM
  proxy cont.26 used). Resolved lazily — worldspawn installs the rules before objective ents spawn.
  `IsTeamplay()` override now == `IsTeamMode()`; folds the old explicit objective-manager scan out of
  the cont.26 Think powerup gate.
- `InitTeams`/`RecountTeams`/`GetTeamIndex`(override)/`GetIndexedTeamName`(override)/`GetTeamID`
  (override → TeamID())/`TeamWithFewestPlayers` — mirror the SDK team subsystem.
- `AssignToTeam(player, name)`: set `pev->team` **0-based** (0 spec, 1 merc — the FGD/objective
  convention, NOT engine-1-based) + `m_szTeamName` + "model"/"team" infokeys + broadcast gmsgTeamInfo
  + gmsgScoreInfo. `PlayerSpawn` override: MP spawn, then (team mode, if not yet on a valid team)
  auto-balance onto `TeamWithFewestPlayers()` — idempotent across respawns/round restarts.
  `InitHUD` override sends gmsgTeamNames + everyone's team to a connecting client.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, tm_avana, temp probe reverted):** 5 bots auto-balanced fewest-first →
Specialists{Chuck,Sean,sebastian}=3, Mercenaries{Alec,Matt}=2 (exact alternating 0,1,0,1,0 with
ties→lower index). 0 Can't init, no crash. DM regression (ts_wyndham): **0** assignments (IsTeamplay
false), powerup spawner still gated correctly, only the known ts_emitter/ts_particle Can't-inits, no
crash. Clean rebuild boot of tm_avana: probe gone, 0 Can't init, clean shutdown.

**SLICE/next (rest of Track A):** assignment is server auto-balance (faithful = client class menu,
cl_dll); the per-team **cash economy** (GetTeamCash/initial_cash @+0x1c, CashBased(), price
s_weapon_info+0xd8) + the **buy menu** server half (AddItemToArmament@0x83ea4 / BuyArmament@0x83f10 /
BuyWeapon@0x845bc) are not built; team **scores** still go through cont.31's `m_teamScore[]` (not the
faithful UpdateTeamScores/InitTeamScore); full `RestartRound`@0x67920 (round timer + game-mode member
+ InitObjectives/SetObjective) deferred; no friendly-fire (FPlayerCanTakeDamage) yet. Now that
pev->team is real, the **CTF/escape entities** (CTSFlag/CTSBriefcase/CTSBomb/CTSTeamEscape/CVipEscape/
CTSSellZone/CTSScoreGiver) are unblocked.

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 34) — CTSTrigger (TS brush trigger; team-gated, recheck delay)

**Done — `CTSTrigger` in `dlls/ts_objectives.cpp` (ts_trigger).** A reusable TS brush trigger.
RE (from the .so): Spawn @0x709b8 (brush SET_MODEL), WaitTouch @0x70ad8 — cooldown gate (param+0x41),
living-player check, attacker-team gate (GetTeamIndex vs +0x42), "Flag Carrier Only" spawnflag (0x1a0
& 8 → HaveFlag), FireTargets(target) + a sprintf'd HUD message, re-arm at time + max(0.5, nextcheck).
Functional reconstruction as `CTSTrigger : CTSObjective` (reuses cont.25's attackerteam + CanInteract):
KeyValue nextcheck (+ attackerteam); WaitTouch: cooldown → CanInteract(pev->team) → FireTargets +
TSHudMessageAll → arm next-allowed.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, SYNTHETIC — 0 stock placements):** a touch fired + armed the
cooldown (nextAllowed → t+2); an immediate re-touch was blocked. Factory `ts_trigger` exported; no
crash; clean regression (tm_avana, 0 Can't init).

**SLICE:** the "Flag Carrier Only" spawnflag needs the CTF flag system (not built) → ignored; the team
gate uses pev->team (now real as of cont.35).

**Session status:** ~25 TS classes reconstructed (the self-contained server-side gameplay is
essentially complete). Remaining = the big/client-entangled subsystems: faithful team mode + cash
(team assignment, SetTeamList, scores, the full RestartRound), the buy menu, the CTF entities
(CTSFlag/CTSBriefcase/CTSBomb/CTSTeamEscape/CVipEscape — need teams), CTSStunt (movement, client),
and the cl_dll side (visible time-dilation, particles CTSSharedEmitter/CTSEmitter/CTSParticle, HUDs).

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 33) — CTSSlowMotionPoint (the slow-motion bubble; powerup→GoSlow link)

**Done — `dlls/ts_slowmotionpoint.cpp`.** Un-SLICEs the deferred SlowMotionFlow link from
cont.14/15: an activated slow-motion powerup now actually drops nearby players into slow-motion.

RE (from the .so): CTSSlowMotionPoint (CreateSlowMotionPoint @0x69c60, ActivateSlow @0x663d0 sets
+0xe8 endtime/+0xec scale/+0xf4 bullets, WaitThink @0x71728). WaitThink polls every 0.5s: for each
living player, if `!InSlow()` and a TraceLine from the point to the player's eye is clear (LOS) →
`GoSlow(scale, bullets)` + track; at the end time → DeactivateSlow (restore tracked) + UTIL_Remove.
A runtime entity (0 FGD placements), created by the powerup/SlowMotionFlow.
Functional reconstruction on cont.15's CBasePlayer::GoSlow/InSlow:
- `CTSSlowMotionPoint : CBaseEntity`: ActivateSlow + WaitThink (LOS GoSlow) + DeactivateSlow (restore
  m_hSlowed[]). `TSCreateSlowMotionPoint(origin, scale, duration, bullets, owner)`.
- `CBasePlayer::UsePowerUp`: a slow-motion(0.6)/slow-pause(0.8) powerup spawns a bubble at the player
  (owner = activator, the powerup duration).

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, SYNTHETIC — 0 stock placements):** a bubble at bot1 (owner)
with bot2 adjacent → bot2 `InSlow()=1 go=0.60`, owner bot1 `InSlow()=0` (skipped); at expiry the
bubble removed itself + restored bot2 (InSlow=0). No crash; clean regression (ts_theatre, powerups).

**SLICE:** the visible time-dilation MOVEMENT is still client-side (GoSlow sets server fields only);
the owner is skipped (stays "fast" = bullet-time feel) vs the .so's exact LOS set; no projectile slow.

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 32) — CTSDMHill (king-of-the-hill brush volume)

**Done — `dlls/ts_dmhill.cpp` (ts_dmhill).** A self-contained DM game-mode entity (no team/client
dependency). The `tm_`/team subsystem is the big remaining work, so this is a clean faithful
self-contained increment.

RE (from the .so): CTSDMHill (Spawn @0x71a8c brush SET_MODEL + SetSize, KeyValue @0x719b8, WaitTouch
@0x71be8 1433 bytes — tracks a single holder, awards `fragamt` (DM) / `fragamtteam` (team) frags to
pev->frags + gmsgScoreInfo + a "<netname> <message>" broadcast once held `nextcheck` seconds).
Functional reconstruction: a 0.5s `HillThink` polls the volume (`Intersects`) — exactly one living
player inside earns the timed award; 0 or 2+ (empty/contested) resets the king. KeyValue
nextcheck/fragamt/fragamtteam (+ message via the Target base).

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, SYNTHETIC — ts_dmhill has 0 stock placements):** a hill
instantiated around a sole bot awarded fragamt on the timer (frags 0→5). Factory `ts_dmhill`
exported; no crash; clean regression. (Build + synthetic only, like ts_timer/ts_customtarget — no
stock map exercises it; a hand-made test map would confirm in-map.)

**SLICE:** the .so's same-team-holders-don't-reset nuance simplified to "sole occupant".

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 31) — CTSGameRules::TeamWin + round restart (objective win ends the round)

**Done — the objective→win→round-restart chain.** Completes cont.25, where `CTSWinGiver::Use`
was a SLICE that only announced. The win now goes through the game rules (first piece of the
team subsystem).
- `CTSGameRules::TeamWin(team)`: bump `m_teamScore[team]`, announce the winner (TSHudMessageAll),
  schedule a restart 3s out (`m_flRoundRestart`; the .so TeamWin @0x68e00 uses param_1+0xc = time+3).
- `CTSGameRules::Think`: when `m_flRoundRestart` elapses, `TSRestartRound` respawns every player
  (SDK `respawn()`) + re-arms the objectives (re-Spawn each ts_wingiver/ts_hack) + announces.
- `CTSWinGiver::Use` → `TSGameRules()->TeamWin(m_winnerTeam)` (the inline announce removed).

**Verified RUNTIME (tm_avana, temp probe reverted):** firing the wingiver (winnerteam 2 = draw →
teams 0/1 unchanged, correct) scheduled a restart (pending=12.0); 3s later it fired → players
respawned + the wingiver re-armed (done=0). No crash; clean regression (ts_wyndham + tm_avana).

**SLICE:** faithful TeamWin awards victory/defeat cash + drives the round-time HUD; the full round
timer + the TS game-mode member + InitObjectives/SetObjective remain the team-subsystem TODO
(RestartRound @0x67920 ~1100 bytes, TeamWin @0x68e00 ~1564). No team ASSIGNMENT yet (scores track
the winnerteam the objective names, not per-player teams).

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 30) — CTSAmmoPack (drop ammo on death; consumable per-caliber pack)

**Done — `dlls/ts_ammopack.cpp`.** Completes the death-loot story: weapons (cont.27) + corpse
(cont.28) + now ammo. The dead player's per-caliber reserve drops as one consumable pack.

RE (from the .so): `CTSAmmoPack` (CreateAmmoPack @0xa1334 copies a 16-int per-caliber array;
Spawn @0xa13f4 model `ammopack.mdl` + `movetype=6` TOSS + `solid=2`; WaitTouch @0xa16c0 loops the
16 calibers calling `CTSGun::AddAmmo` and ZEROES each given entry — CONSUMABLE, vs the persistent
CTSGroundAmmo station cont.17). FUNCTIONAL reconstruction on the stock SDK (no CTSPhysicObject):
- `CTSAmmoPack : CBaseEntity` (ts_ammopack) carrying `m_ammo[16]`: MOVETYPE_TOSS → FallThink settle
  → SOLID_TRIGGER + WaitTouch. WaitTouch: for a TS-gun holder, `TSAddAmmo` each caliber, zero what
  was taken, UTIL_Remove when emptied. `TSCreateAmmoPack(owner, counts[16], origin, vel)`.
- `TSDropAmmoOnDeath(player)` (ts_gun.cpp): drop the gun's `m_ammoReserve[16]` as one pack.
- `CTSGameRules::PlayerKilled` now also calls it. `ammopack.mdl` precached at map load.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, temp probe reverted):** killing a beretta-holding bot
dropped a pack carrying 9mm=45; a live tsgun holder touching it received the 9mm (pack m_ammo[1]
45→0) and the emptied pack was UTIL_Remove'd (deferred to frame end). No crash; clean regression
(factory `ts_ammopack` exported).

**SLICE:** no CTSPhysicObject bounce; one pack for the whole reserve (not per-mag); no thrown-pack.

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 29) — CTSShrapnel (grenade-blast fragments)

**Done — `CTSShrapnel` in `dlls/ts_grenade.cpp`.** The grenade explosion (cont.20 CM61Grenade)
now throws damaging fragments, matching the .so (a grenade Detonate spawns CTSShrapnel).

RE (from the .so): `CTSShrapnel : CTSPhysicObject` (Create @0x7bf9c, Spawn @0x7c0a0 with
`models/shrapnel.mdl` + `movetype=10` MOVETYPE_BOUNCE + `solid=2`, BounceTouch @0x7c200
TraceAttacks on contact, WaitThink @0x7c678 lifetime). FUNCTIONAL reconstruction on the stock SDK
(no CTSPhysicObject):
- `CTSShrapnel : CBaseEntity` (ts_shrapnel): MOVETYPE_BOUNCE + SOLID_BBOX; BounceTouch TraceAttacks
  a damageable hit (14 dmg DMG_BULLET, then remove) or bounces off the world ≤2× before expiring;
  1.5s FadeThink. `Create(owner, origin, velocity)`.
- `CM61Grenade::M61Tumble`/`M61Detonate` replace the stock TumbleThink→Detonate: tumble in flight,
  then at the fuse spawn 10 random-direction fragments + `CGrenade::Detonate` (stock area blast).
- `models/shrapnel.mdl` precached at map load (PrecacheAllTSWeapons; valve fallback model).

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, temp probe reverted):** a thrown grenade detonated and
spawned the shrapnel burst (fragments bounce, several alive post-blast), no crash; clean
regression (factory `ts_shrapnel` exported).

**SLICE:** no CTSPhysicObject bounce, fixed 10 fragments/14 dmg, no fragment trail/sound.

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 28) — Death handling: CTSDeadCorpse + drop-arsenal-on-death

**Done — `dlls/ts_corpse.cpp` + a `CTSGameRules::PlayerKilled` hook.** Completes the on-death side
left open in cont.27 and adds the TS death body.

RE (from the .so): `CTSDeadCorpse` (Spawn @0x7040c, WaitThink @0x70460) + `TSCreateDeadCorpse`
(@0x60234). The corpse is `CBaseEntity::Create("…")` copying the player's origin/angles (rep movsl)
+ pev->model (+0xb8), modelindex (+0xb4), sequence/frame (+0x130/+0x1a8), `movetype = 6`
(MOVETYPE_TOSS @+0x108); WaitThink (0.5s) ramps renderamt down by `((fadeEnd-time)/(lifetime*0.667))*255`
then UTIL_Remove. Functional reconstruction:
- `CTSDeadCorpse : CBaseAnimating` (ts_corpse): MOVETYPE_TOSS + SOLID_NOT + kRenderTransTexture;
  `FadeThink` fades renderamt then removes (15s lifetime). `TSCreateDeadCorpse(player, lifetime)`
  copies model/origin/angles/sequence/frame(framerate 0 = frozen)/body/skin/colormap.
- `TSDropWeaponsOnDeath(player)` (ts_gun.cpp): scatter the whole arsenal into the world as
  CTSWorldGuns (random toss) — the on-death drop noted as SLICE in cont.27.
- `CTSGameRules::PlayerKilled` override: `CHalfLifeMultiplay::PlayerKilled` (scoring/death-notice),
  then drop weapons + spawn the corpse.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, temp probe reverted):** a bot given beretta+uzi then
force-killed (suicide TakeDamage) produced exactly **1 ts_corpse + 2 ts_worldgun**; no crash; clean
regression (factory `ts_corpse` exported).

**SLICE:** corpse copies the live pose at PlayerKilled time (no dedicated death-anim capture);
melee/no-world-model weapons aren't dropped; no gib/blood. The on-death weapon drop now means the
CTSWorldGuns are reachable in normal play (kill someone → their guns drop, press USE to grab).

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 27) — CTSWorldGun (player-dropped weapons: drop + USE-pickup)

**Done — `dlls/ts_worldgun.cpp`: the dropped-weapon-in-the-world entity.** Completes the weapon
lifecycle (map pickups via CTSGroundWeapon cont.11; player drops here).

RE (from the .so): `CTSWorldGun : CTSPhysicObject` carries a tsweapon_t (+0x88) + the full
s_weapon_status (14 ints); created by `CBasePlayer::DropWeapon`/`ThrowWeapon` -> `CTSGun::DropWeapon`
(removes from the arsenal) -> `CTSWorldGun::CreateWeapon`. `GetWeapon` (@0xa1198) -> `PickUpWeapon`;
`WaitTouch` (@0xa1250) gates pickup on `pev->button & IN_USE` (0x20) (or auto for the flag, type 0x1d).
FUNCTIONAL reconstruction on the stock SDK (CM61Grenade-style; no CTSPhysicObject):
- `CTSWorldGun : CBaseEntity` carrying type + loaded clip. Spawn: w_model + MOVETYPE_TOSS;
  FallThink settles on FL_ONGROUND -> SOLID_TRIGGER + WaitTouch. WaitTouch: living player pressing
  IN_USE -> TSPickUpWeapon + UTIL_Remove.
- `TSCreateWorldGun(type, clip, origin, vel)` = the drop side.
- `CTSGun::RemoveActiveWeapon(type, clip)` (@DropWeapon 0x8094c): shift the active slot out of the
  arsenal (requires >=2 weapons — no unarmed state, SLICE), wield the next; free `TSDropActiveWeapon`/
  `TSPickUpWeapon` (the latter re-adds via GiveTSWeapon + restores the carried clip).
- `dropweapon` ClientCommand drops the active weapon forward (250u + player velocity).

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, temp probe reverted):** a bot holding {beretta, uzi} dropped
the uzi (type 3, clip 32; arsenal 2->1) -> ts_worldgun spawned + settled (SOLID_TRIGGER); a forced
USE-touch handed the uzi back (holds weapon_tsgun, world gun removed). No crash; clean regression
(factory `ts_worldgun` exported).

**SLICE:** no CTSPhysicObject bounce, carries type+clip only (the shared caliber reserve stays with
the dropper), no on-death auto-drop, no flag auto-pickup, no throw arc.

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 26) — CTSGameRules::PutPowerUp (dynamic deathmatch powerup spawning)

**Done — the dynamic powerup spawner.** Un-SLICEs the `CTSGameRules::PutPowerUp` (@0x9797c)
niche left in cont.13. DM maps now spawn powerups dynamically even without ts_powerup placements.
- `CTSGameRules::PutPowerUp(type)`: collect `info_player_deathmatch` spots (cap 32), pick a
  random one, skip if a `ts_powerup` is already within 128u, else create a powerup there via a
  new `TSCreatePowerUpAt(type, origin)` free helper (ts_powerup.cpp; wraps
  `CTSPowerUp::CreatePowerUp` + UTIL_SetOrigin so it drops from the spot).
- `CTSGameRules::Think` override (the rules object now runs TS think): `CHalfLifeMultiplay::Think()`
  then, in DM only, roll `GetRandomPowerup(0x1ff)` every ~20s and PutPowerUp it (1s retry on
  fail). Mirrors the .so Think powerup block (`if mode<2 … every 20s`). DM gate = `!IsTeamplay()`
  (which as of cont.35 == the objective-manager proxy).

**Verified RUNTIME (temp probe reverted):** ts_wyndham (DM) spawned a random powerup every 20s
(t=1 kungfu, t=21 slowmo, t=41 kungfu); tm_avana (objective map) correctly skipped (0 spawns).
No crash; clean regression.

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 25) — Objective subsystem (ts_hack/wingiver/manager/ptr) — team-mode maps

**Done — `dlls/ts_objectives.cpp`: the 4 objective entity types the `tm_` maps place.** Loading
a team-mode map (tm_avana) showed 7 Can't-inits: ts_hack(2), ts_objective_manager(1),
ts_objective_ptr(1), ts_wingiver(3). All cleared.

RE (from the .so): these are point/brush entities tied into a CTSGameRules team subsystem
(`TeamWin` @0x68a08 1564 bytes, `ShowObjectiveOnHud`, `AddObjectiveInList`) that ISN'T built —
the interaction "who is hacking" + the win scoring/round-restart are gamerules-driven. Built a
FUNCTIONAL standalone reconstruction instead:
- `CTSObjective` (base @0x8c2b0): `attackerteam` keyvalue (+0x68, -1=any) + CanInteract(team)/
  Freeze(bool). (.so Freeze also calls ShowObjectiveOnHud — SLICE.)
- `CTSObjectiveManager` (@0x8b7bc, ts_objective_manager): objptargeta..h / messagea..d /
  targeton{timeleft,specdead,mercdead} keyvalues; `Reset()` HUDs the messages + FireTargets the
  8 objptargets (matches @Reset 0x8b850).
- `CTSObjectivePointer` (@0x8bb44, ts_objective_ptr): per-team objmsg{spec,merc,team3,team4,all}
  (the visible HUD arrow is cl_dll — server stub).
- `CTSHack` (@0x8cccc, ts_hack): brush; SET_MODEL + SOLID_TRIGGER; an attacker-team living player
  in the volume (HackTouch) drives a `hackingtime` countdown (WaitThink, 1s cadence like the .so);
  on 0 → fire pev->target + HUD pev->message + Freeze. SLICE: faithful start-hack is gamerules-driven.
- `CTSWinGiver` (@0x8bf10, ts_wingiver): Use'd `callsnumber` times → declares `winnerteam` (HUD).
  SLICE: faithful Use → CTSGameRules::TeamWin(team, victory/defeat cash, …) + round restart.

**Verified RUNTIME (tm_avana, temp probe reverted):** 2 hack / 3 wingiver / 1 manager / 1 ptr
spawn (0 Can't init, was 7); keyvalues parse (hack time=10 attackerteam=-1, wingiver team=2
calls 1); a forced-hacker hack counted 10→0 and completed (done=1); wingiver Use → declares the
winner (done=1). tm_corporate also 0 Can't init. No crash; clean.

**Next:** the real payoff is the **CTSGameRules team subsystem** (TeamWin/team assignment/scores/
RestartRound) — it turns these standalone entities into an actual scored team game mode and
unblocks the rest of the tm_ maps (ts_briefcase/ts_bomb/ts_flag CTF). Still also: the buy menu,
CTSSharedEmitter (cl_dll), the visible slow-motion (cl_dll).

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 24) — Shotgun fidelity: 8-pellet count + mossberg/sawedoff fire-types

**Done — closed the two known weapon data gaps.**
- s_weapon_info gains `iPellets` (bullets-per-shot, `s_weapon_info+0x24`): **8 for the five
  shotguns** (benelli/usas/spas/mossberg/sawed-off), 1 otherwise (extracted from each
  Write_<weapon>). `StandardFire` uses it instead of the hardcoded `(ft==PUMP)?6:1` guess —
  which was both wrong (8, not 6) and missed usas/sawedoff (not pump fire-type but 8 pellets).
- Fixed two fire-types the OLD extract_weapons.py mis-read as 0 (reading the Write_ funcs
  directly gives the truth): **mossberg 0→1 (pump), sawedoff 0→8 (semi, twin-barrel)**.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, temp probe reverted):** mossberg fireType=1 pellets=8,
sawedoff fireType=8 pellets=8, usas fireType=6 pellets=8, beretta control pellets=1; all fire
without crash. Clean regression.

**Note on the bigger picture:** the weapon engine is now functionally complete (arsenal,
all fire-types, akimbo, fire-mode/burst, per-caliber ammo, correct pellets). The remaining TS
gameplay systems are all LARGE/interconnected or client-entangled: the buy menu (cash economy
@BuyWeapon checks CashBased()/weapon price s_weapon_info+0xd8/player cash +0x540 + a client
menu UI), the team/objective subsystem (CTSGameRules::TeamWin @0x68a08 is 1564 bytes atop
SetTeamList/UpdateTeamScores/RestartRound/InitTeamScore — all the ts_wingiver/ts_hack/
ts_briefcase entities live in tm_ maps needing it), the networked particles (CTSSharedEmitter,
needs cl_dll), and the visible slow-motion time-dilation (needs cl_dll). Next agent: pick the
team foundation (biggest gameplay unlock, server-side) or the buy menu server half.

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 23) — Per-caliber ammo (CTSGun::AddAmmo + CTSGroundAmmo wiring)

**Done — the faithful per-caliber ammo system.** Un-SLICEs the per-slot generic reserve +
the CTSGroundAmmo 9mm-only refill; ammo is now pooled per caliber and shared across same-
caliber weapons (a single beretta + akimbo berettas draw from one 9mm pool).

RE findings (from the .so):
- Each weapon names a CALIBER byte at `s_weapon_info+0x8` (extracted from each Write_<weapon>):
  0 none(melee/grenade), 1 9x19, 2 .45, 3 SHELLS, 4 5.56, 5 .50AE, 6 7.62, 7 5.7, 8 50BMG,
  9 10mm, 10 .22, 11 .454, 12 .32, 13 .45LC. The gun holds 16 per-caliber reserves at `+0xd4`.
- `compile_ammo_info` (@0x6f51c) builds a per-caliber table (stride 0x38): +0x10 = magazine
  size, **+0x20 = max reserve (rounds)** — 9mm 80, .45 90, shells 90, 5.56 150, 7.62 170,
  50BMG 200, … (full table extracted).
- `AddAmmo(caliber,count)` (@0x808ac): `reserve[caliber] = min(reserve+count, max[caliber])`.
- `ReloadWeapon` (@0x84a14): `take = min(clipSize - clip, reserve[caliber])` → reserve is in
  ROUNDS, drawn into the clip. (Settled the rounds-vs-mags question.)
- `CTSGroundAmmo::WaitTouch` (@0xa2f40): loops the 16 calibers calling `AddAmmo(gun, cal,
  m_mags[cal])` — the FGD `magsN` keyvalues add raw rounds to caliber N (the station persists,
  topping up on every touch; real maps set magsN = 3–5).

Functional reconstruction:
- `ts_weapons.{h,cpp}`: s_weapon_info gains `iCaliber` (the +0x8 byte, full table); `kAmmoMax[16]`
  + `TSAmmoMax(caliber)`.
- `ts_gun.cpp` CTSGun: **replaced the per-slot `m_arsenalReserve[]` with per-caliber
  `m_ammoReserve[16]`**. `AddAmmo` method (capped). Spawn/AddWeapon seed the caliber reserve
  (clip*3); the akimbo upgrade adds the 2nd pistol's rounds to the shared pool; Reload draws
  from `m_ammoReserve[caliber]`; MultiplyClips (inf-clip powerup) tops the active caliber.
  Free `TSAddAmmo(player, caliber, count)`.
- `ts_groundammo.cpp` WaitTouch: per-caliber `TSAddAmmo(player, cal, m_mags[cal-1])` (was the
  9mm-only SLICE).

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, temp probe reverted):** beretta → clip 15 / 9mm reserve
45; emptied clip → Reload drew 15 from the 9mm pool → 15/30; 2nd beretta → akimbo (type 8) +
SHARES the 9mm pool (reserve 30+15=45); +m16 → 5.56 reserve 54, 9mm unchanged (separate pools);
40× AddAmmo(1,3) capped at max 80. Clean regression on ts_supertimor_d3 (6 ground-ammo packs):
0 Can't init, 0 crashes.

**SLICE/deferred:** starting reserve = clip*3 (the faithful buy menu / BuyArmament sets the real
loadout); calibers 12/13 (skorpion/contender) have no ground-ammo magN; no client ammo HUD;
grenade (caliber 0) still uses its own m_iClip count (no caliber reserve).

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 22) — Fire-mode system (auto/semi/burst/pump + SwitchFireMode)

**Done — the faithful trigger engine.** Auto/semi/burst/pump is now decided by a per-slot
FIRE-MODE (orthogonal to fire-type, which still picks the fire *function*) — replacing the
old fire-type-based auto/semi approximation.

RE findings (from the .so):
- `PrimaryAttack` (@0x81a20): melee/grenade/katana/flag dispatch by fire-type FIRST (outside
  the mode system); the bullet/akimbo path then gates on the fire-mode byte `m_pActiveItem+2`:
  mode 0 full-auto (held), 1 semi (per-press; dblfire powerup → held), 2 burst (set count on
  press, return — fired by WeaponIdle), 3 pump (held), 4 akimbo-alt (per-press), 5 akimbo-both
  (held). Burst count = `(weaponType != 0x17) + 2` → **3 rounds, 2 for the MAC-10 (0x17)**.
- `WeaponIdle` (@0x854dc): while firemode==2 and burst count>0 and the idle timer elapsed →
  `Fire()` + count-- (this completes a tapped burst after the trigger is released).
- `StandardFire` (@0x824a4): burst rate = 0.03 between rounds, 0.2 after the last.
- `SwitchFireMode` (@0x8169c): cycle the mode byte to the next bit set in the weapon's mode
  MASK at `s_weapon_info+0xc`, modes 0..5 wrapping. Default mode (`TakeWeapon`): auto if
  offered, else pump, else burst, else semi. Masks extracted from each `Write_<weapon>`
  (`movl $imm,0xc(%eax)`): e.g. beretta=2 (semi), uzi=3 (auto+semi), m16=6 (semi+burst,
  defaults burst), mp5sd/mp5k/mac10=7 (auto+semi+burst), akimbos 18/33.

Functional reconstruction:
- `ts_weapons.{h,cpp}`: s_weapon_info gains `iFireModes` (the +0xc mask, full table extracted);
  `enum tsfiremode_mode_t`; `TSDefaultFireMode(mask)`.
- `ts_gun.cpp` CTSGun: per-slot `m_arsenalMode[]` + active `m_fireMode` + `m_burstCount`
  (saved/loaded by SelectSlot; defaulted in Spawn/AddWeapon/akimbo-upgrade). PrimaryAttack
  rewritten to gate by m_fireMode → `Fire()` (dispatches by fire-type: AkimboFire or the new
  `StandardFire`, factored from the old inline bullet code). WeaponIdle drives the burst.
  `SwitchFireMode()` + free `TSSwitchFireMode` + the `tsfiremode` ClientCommand.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, temp probe reverted):** default modes correct for all
masks (beretta→1 semi, uzi→0 auto, m16→2 burst, mp5sd→0 auto); `SwitchFireMode` cycles only
the available modes (beretta stays 1; uzi 1↔0; m16 1↔2; mp5sd 1→2→0); m16 burst fired exactly
3 rounds per tap (clip 18→15, burst 3→0). No crash; clean regression (only the known
`ts_emitter`/`ts_particle` Can't-inits remain).

**SLICE/deferred:** burst sustain depends on the SDK ItemPostFrame/WeaponIdle cadence (a held
burst fires via PrimaryAttack, a tapped one finishes via WeaponIdle); no client-side fire-mode
HUD indicator (the .so writes `mode+1` to player+0x49a per weapon); pump (mode 3) doesn't yet
play a pump-action animation; the dblfire→semi-auto-continuous interaction is approximated.

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 21) — Akimbo (fire-types 4/5): dual-wield upgrade + AkimboFire

**Done — akimbo dual-wielding.** Un-SLICEs fire-types 4 (combinable) & 5 (gold-only),
the last unhandled PrimaryAttack fire-type.

RE findings (from the .so):
- `IsWeaponAkimbo(t)` = `get_weapon_info(t)->iFireType==4`; `IsOnlyAkimbo(t)` = `==5`
  (objdump @0x7019c/0x701d4 — both just compare the +0x348 fire-type byte).
- Akimbo PAIRING fields in s_weapon_info: **+0xc8** = the akimbo variant a single pistol
  upgrades into (-1 if none); **+0xcc** = the single base of an akimbo (= self for
  non-akimbo). Read from each `Write_<weapon>` (`movl $imm,0xc8/0xcc(%eax)`; the table is
  .bss so file reads are garbage — must read the Write_ funcs). Pairs: 2↔8 (beretta),
  3↔16 (uzi), 9↔10 (mk23), 14↔30 (fnh), 17↔37 (skorpion); gold(21) is ft-5, no single.
- `TakeWeapon` (@0x80a04): owning the single + picking up an identical 2nd → `local_12`
  becomes the +0xc8 akimbo → combines in place (clip = sum of both barrels). `AkimboFire`
  (@0x829c0) splits the clip into left/right barrels (m_pActiveItem+0x1c/+0x20), alternates
  the firing barrel (one per IN_ATTACK/IN_ATTACK2) from a ±5u right-vector muzzle offset;
  rate = flFireRate, or fixed 0.1 in alternating fire-mode.

Functional reconstruction (on the cont.18 single-clip arsenal):
- `ts_weapons.{h,cpp}`: s_weapon_info gains `iAkimboType`/`iSingleType`; set in
  compile_weapons_info. Added `TSFT_AKIMBO_ONLY=5`.
- `CTSGun::AddWeapon`: if you already hold the single + it has an akimbo upgrade + don't
  hold the akimbo → upgrade the slot in place (SelectSlot first so m_iClip is live, then
  type→akimbo, clip = single's rounds + a 2nd pistol capped at the doubled clip, reserve
  += a 2nd pistol, re-Deploy). Slot count stays the same (not a new slot).
- `CTSGun::AkimboFire(wi)` (dispatched for ft 4/5): full-auto-feel (fires while held — no
  IN_ATTACK2 plumbed), `m_akimboSide ^= 1` each shot → ±5u v_right muzzle offset, one
  bullet/clip-- per shot, flSpread/flDamage/flFireRate (+ DoubleFireRate powerup halving).

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, temp probe reverted):** gave a bot beretta, then a
2nd beretta → upgraded in place to **type 8 (beretta_akimbo), clip 30** (15+15 capped),
reserve 60, arsenal count stayed 1. Held trigger → AkimboFire fired (clip 30→26→16→6, then
reload from reserve → 26, side toggled 0↔1), active item = the gun. No crash; clean
regression (0 crashes; only the known `ts_emitter`/`ts_particle` Can't-init remain).

**SLICE/deferred:** single active clip (not a true L/R barrel split); no IN_ATTACK2
"fire both barrels at once" (firemode 5 path); no per-barrel reload; the akimbo's separate
view-model akimbo animation events are not wired. Fire-mode/burst (`SwitchFireMode`) and the
buy menu remain the next weapon-engine items.

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 20) — CM61Grenade (grenade fire-type 2 throws a grenade)

**Done — `dlls/ts_grenade.cpp` CM61Grenade + the grenade fire-type.** Un-SLICEs
fire-type 2 (was falling back to bullets) + makes the grenade powerup useful.
- The faithful CM61Grenade is `CM61Grenade : CTSGrenade : CTSPhysicObject` (TS physics
  base classes, not built) with event-driven creation + a custom WaitThink (traces 64u
  ahead for near-impact detonation). FUNCTIONAL reconstruction onto the stock SDK
  `CGrenade` instead (which already does arc/bounce/timed-detonate): `CM61Grenade::Throw`
  replicates `CGrenade::ShootTimed` but with `w_m61.mdl` (so no models/grenade.mdl
  precache dependency) — MOVETYPE_BOUNCE, `CGrenade::BounceTouch`, `TumbleThink`→
  `Detonate` at dmgtime, gravity 0.5/friction 0.8. Free `TSThrowM61(pevOwner, src, vel,
  fuse, dmg)`.
- `CTSGun::PrimaryAttack` dispatches TSFT_GRENADE (2) → new `GrenadeThrow(wi)`: one throw
  per press, decrement clip, toss from gun-pos+16 forward at 800u + player velocity, 4s
  fuse, damage = table flDamage*4 (~120). (m61 table dmg 30 is the per-pickup value; the
  explosion is area damage.)

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, temp probe reverted):** a bot with the M61 threw
100 grenades over 30s (valid entities, clip decrementing); TumbleThink switches to
Detonate at dmgtime (model-independent: `if (dmgtime <= time) SetThink(Detonate)`), so
they arc/bounce/explode. No crash; clean regression.

**SLICE/deferred:** no CTSPhysicObject physics, no impact-trace early detonation, no
throw event/animation; akimbo (fire-types 4/5) still falls back to bullets.

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 19) — Powerup→weapon wiring: MultiplyClips + DoubleFireRate

**Done — two now-easy powerup effects, faithful on the cont.18 arsenal.** Completes
the powerup→weapon connection.
- `CTSGun::MultiplyClips()` (@0x71308, the infinite-clip powerup): doubles the active
  arsenal slot's reserve (>= a full resupply, capped ~6 clips). Free `TSMultiplyClips
  (player)` wraps it (GetPlayerTSGun). `PlayerAddPowerUp`'s inf-clip branch now calls it
  (was a SLICE clip-refill).
- `CTSGun::PrimaryAttack`: `if (DoubleFireRate(m_pPlayer)) flRate *= 0.5` — the
  double-firerate powerup now halves the fire interval (the accessor already flips true
  while the dblfire powerup is active; just wired into the rate).

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, temp probe reverted):** beretta inf-clip reserve
45→90 (doubled); dblfire baseRate 0.100 → rate 0.050 (halved), 105 fires at the doubled
rate. No crash; clean regression.

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 18) — CTSGun weapon arsenal (the items-array, modern reconstruction)

**Done — the player's weapon_tsgun now holds a multi-weapon ARSENAL.** A clean
MODERN reconstruction of the original items-array (the faithful one is a 0x38-byte
s_weapon_status items[] @CTSGun+0x114 with m_pActiveItem@0xcc / m_pActiveInfo@0xd0 +
weapon/ammo-group masks + akimbo pairing — heavy byte layout, reconstructed from
intent, not transcribed).
- `dlls/ts_gun.cpp` CTSGun: added parallel arrays `m_arsenalType/Clip/Reserve[12]` +
  `m_arsenalCount` + `m_active`. `m_weaponType` now tracks the active slot (so the
  fire-type dispatch + Deploy are unchanged).
- `FindSlot(type)` / `AddWeapon(type)` (@AddItem__6CTSGun: add a slot or resupply,
  then wield) / `SelectSlot(slot)` (@SelectWeapon__6CTSGun: save the wielded clip,
  load the new slot's, re-Deploy if held).
- `Spawn` seeds the arsenal with the placed type (clip full, reserve = 3 clips).
- `PrimaryAttack` unchanged (operates on m_iClip = the active slot's clip). `Reload`
  now refills m_iClip from the active slot's own reserve (not DefaultReload).
- `GiveTSWeapon(player, type)`: if the player already holds weapon_tsgun, AddWeapon
  to it; else create + pick up. (Helper `GetPlayerTSGun` walks m_rgpPlayerItems.)
- `CTSGroundWeapon::GetWeapon`: dropped the "one TS weapon at a time" guard — picking
  up a ground weapon now ADDS it to the arsenal.
- `tsnextweapon` ClientCommand → `TSCycleWeapon` cycles the active slot.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot, ts_wyndham, temp probe reverted):** a bot built a 3-weapon
arsenal (beretta→+uzi→+knife), `tsnextweapon` cycled 0→1→2→0 through all three, each
deploying its own view model with its own clip/reserve (beretta 15/45, uzi 32/96,
knife 18/54). PER-SLOT CLIP PERSISTS: the bot fired the uzi (clip 32→30) and the count
survived switching away+back. No crash; clean regression (0 Can't init, 0 crashes).

**SLICE/deferred:** no akimbo pairing (single active slot — the faithful engine wields
two for fire-types 4/5), no weapon/ammo-groups, no fire-mode/burst state, no buy menu
(`BuyWeapon`/`BuyArmament`); the per-caliber ammo reserve is still per-slot generic (not
wired to CTSGroundAmmo's calibers). The grenade/akimbo PrimaryAttack fire-types still
fall back to bullets.

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 17) — CTSGroundAmmo (ts_groundammo refill pack, 16 placements)

**Done — `dlls/ts_groundammo.cpp` CTSGroundAmmo : CBaseEntity.** A map-placed ammo
pack; lifecycle mirrors CTSPowerUp (Spawn→Fall→OnGround settle→WaitTouch/WaitThink),
recovered from the .so (Spawn/OnGround tails truncated by Ghidra noreturn at
UTIL_SetOrigin → read via objdump):
- Spawn: model `models/ammopack.mdl`; movetype = MOVETYPE_FLY (wall, spawnflag 16) or
  MOVETYPE_TOSS (floor); solid SOLID_BBOX; SetThink(Fall) + nextthink time+0.1.
- Fall: settle on FL_ONGROUND → OnGround (or PutOnWall for the wall variant) + drop
  sound. OnGround: SOLID_TRIGGER, MOVETYPE_FLY (stop), clear EF_NODRAW + EF_DIMLIGHT,
  SetTouch(WaitTouch)+SetThink(WaitThink). WaitThink idles (nextthink+1).
- KeyValue: wduration → m_respawnTime; mags1..mags11 (parse the index off "mags") →
  m_mags[0..10] (per-caliber magazine counts: 9x19/.45/SHELLS/5.56/.50AE/7.62/5.7/
  50BMG/10mm/.22/.454).
- WaitTouch: a visible pack refills a touching ALIVE player who holds a TS gun. The
  pack PERSISTS (tops players up when they have room; not consumed on pickup — matches
  the .so, which has no hide/remove in WaitTouch).
- PutOnWall: SLICE = settle-in-place stub.

**SLICE:** faithful WaitTouch loops the 16 ammo-type slots calling `CTSGun::AddAmmo(
caliber, mags)` on the active gun (the per-caliber reserve = part of the unbuilt
weapon items-array; gate is m_pActiveItem id == 0x10). Here it sums the mags and tops
up the held weapon's **9mm** reserve via `CBasePlayer::GiveAmmo(n, "9mm", _9MM_MAX_CARRY)`.

**Verified RUNTIME (rcbot bots, ts_supertimor_d3 = 6 placements), temp probe (reverted):**
6 settled (`Can't init ts_groundammo` gone); a weapon_tsgun-holding bot touched a pack
(14 mags) → GiveAmmo topped up 9mm by 2 then returned -1 (full) on repeat = correct
capped refill-station behaviour. No crash (gdb -batch, no CTSGroundAmmo in backtrace).
Final clean regression boot: 0 `Can't init`, 0 crashes.

---

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 16) — CTSGun fire-type dispatch (semi/auto/shotgun/melee)

**Done — weapons now fire faithfully by fire-type.** Un-SLICEs "everything is identical
semi-auto bullets".
- `scripts/extract_weapons.py` extended: also pulls per-weapon fire-rate (0x18), base
  spread (0x28), recoil (0x34). Regenerated the table.
- `ts_weapons.{h,cpp}`: s_weapon_info gains flFireRate/flSpread/flRecoil; added
  `enum tsfiretype_t` (0/8 semi, 1 pump, 2 grenade, 3 knife, 4/5 akimbo, 6 auto-shotgun/
  rifle, 7 sniper, 9 SMG-auto, 10 katana, 11 flag).
- `CTSGun::PrimaryAttack` dispatches by iFireType: melee (3/10) → new MeleeAttack()
  hull-trace (knife 48u/katana 64u) + TraceAttack(DMG_CLUB), no bullets; full-auto (9/6)
  fires while held; semi (0/8/7/1 + SLICE akimbo/grenade) one shot per press
  (m_afButtonPressed); pump shotgun (1) → 6 pellets. Uses real flSpread + flFireRate.
- SLICE: grenade(2)/akimbo(4/5) fall back to bullets (need throw entity / items-array,
  where the faithful fire funcs read fire-mode@m_pActiveItem+2 / burst@+8).

**Verified (rcbot, ts_wyndham, probe reverted):** beretta ft=8 SEMI 43 fires (one/press)
vs uzi ft=9 AUTO 201 (held); benellim3 ft=1 6-pellet; knife/katana hull-trace MELEE hit
func_breakable/worldspawn, no bullets. No crash. **Data gaps:** mossberg(26)/sawedoff(33)
fire-type extracted as 0 (are shotguns); pellet count fixed 6; m61 rate/spread suspect.

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 15) — CTSSlowMotion entity + GoSlow/InSlow + GlobalSlowMotion2

**Done — slow-motion STATE layer + `dlls/ts_slowmotion.cpp` (ts_slowmotion brush zone,
11 placements).**
- Slow virtuals `GoSlow`/`InSlow`/`GiveSlowMul` (found via CBasePlayer vtable relocs:
  +0x14 GoSlow, +0x18 InSlow). As **CBasePlayer methods**: GoSlow(scale,bullets) sets
  m_flSlowMotionGo (0x168) + m_flSlowMotionTarget (0x170) + m_bSlowBullets; InSlow() =
  (go!=1||target!=1); both init 1.0.
- `CTSGameRules::GlobalSlowMotion2(scale,bullets)` + SetGlobalSlowMotion: GoSlow every
  player, throttled ~0.5s (members 0x560/0x564/0x568/0x56c). SLICE: no projectiles.
- CTSSlowMotion : CBaseEntity (replaces old draft): Spawn (brush trigger; setup beyond
  classname/model/size INFERRED // VERIFY); KeyValue duration/slowamt; WaitTouch (GoSlow
  toucher, track m_hPlayers[33]); ActivateSlow/DeactivateSlow; WaitThink (0.5s poll);
  CheckPlayersDistance (drop beyond m_flRadius from Center()); Use; Save/Restore.

**Verified (rcbot, ts_wyndham=4):** 4 zones; Use() no crash; GlobalSlowMotion2(0.5,1) →
InSlow()=1 go=0.50; (0,0) → InSlow()=0 go=1.0. No crash.

**SLICE/deferred (visible time-dilation, client-entangled):** actual slow MOVEMENT
(client pmove — no cl_dll); projectile slow; SlowMotionFlow (@0x86bb0, powerup→GoSlow);
InterpolateSlowMotion (@0x8910c); motion-blur HUD; cmd_globalslow; Spawn/m_flRadius inferred.

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 14) — Powerup activation state machine (UsePowerUp/UpdatePowerUpState)

**Done — held timed powerups ACTIVATE + expire.** From UsePowerUp (@0x85980),
UpdatePowerUpState (@0x85748), DeactivateSlowMotionFlow (@0x86a9c):
- CBasePlayer::UsePowerUp() (ts_player.cpp): `usepowerup` command. Alive + holding +
  none active → m_iPowerups = m_iHeldPowerup, expire = m_flPowerupTime + time; sends
  gmsgTSPowerUpTime + gmsgTSMotionBlur. UpdatePowerUpState() per-frame in PreThink:
  apply slow fields (slowmo 0.6, slowpause 0.8) / expire + clear.
- `usepowerup` ClientCommand (confirmed via .so @0x9d838). Players +0x175/0x17c/0x180.

**Verified (ts_theatre):** bot held slowmo (dur 3) + UsePowerUp → m_iPowerups=1,
SlowMotion()=1, scale 0.60 for 3s, expired + cleared. No crash. (Note: activation sets
m_flSlowMotionScale, NOT GoSlow — the powerup→GoSlow link is SlowMotionFlow, deferred.)

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 13) — CTSPowerUp + PlayerAddPowerUp (the 328-placement pickup)

**`dlls/ts_powerup.cpp` CTSPowerUp : CBaseAnimating (ts_powerup, 328 placements).** Full
lifecycle (Spawn + OnGround TRUNCATED by Ghidra noreturn at UTIL_SetOrigin — real tails
via objdump; Spawn's `nextthink = time+0.1` missed → never settled, caught by "22
spawned 0 pickups"). Spawn→Fall→OnGround(SOLID_TRIGGER,SetTouch(WaitTouch))→WaitTouch
(pickup gate: instant mask 0x1e6 always, timed only if none held; re-roll+respawn).
SetupPowerUp: spawnflags = the random MASK (GetRandomPowerup), pwuptype forces exact.
**PlayerAddPowerUp** (@0x87bc8): instant real (armor/kungfu/lowgrav/health/grenade→
GiveTSWeapon(M61) SLICE/infclip SLICE), timed held. Members 0x72c/0x73c. VERIFIED
(ts_theatre=22): 22 spawned all 8 types, 6 pickups, gate works, no crash.

## 2026-06-21 (cont. 12) — Full 38-weapon table + CTSGun by type; gdb debugging

`scripts/extract_weapons.py` → full s_weapon_info table (0x44 name, 0x132 v_model,
0x172 p_model, 0x1f2 w_model, 0x232 anim-ext, 0x2c6 fire snd, 0x04 clip, 0x1c damage,
0x348 fire-type; cont.16 added 0x18/0x28/0x34). CTSGun parameterized by m_weaponType;
ground weapon gives real type. CWorld::Precache → UTIL_PrecacheOtherWeapon at map load.
VERIFIED (ts_wyndham): type 25→v_knife dmg40, type 3→v_uzi dmg22. Two GDB-found crashes
fixed (PRECACHE_EVENT map-load; DeathNotice ItemInfoArray). **Use gdb** for crashes.

## CTSAnimation — 3rd-person playtest observations (user, vs the running original) — SPEC for a live-trace pass
The 4-region Animate rewrite (482a099) was REVERTED (6a8ca20) — it relied on m_fSequenceFinished for the
Region-B hold guards, but that member is NOT reliably advanced for the SERVER-side player model, so stunts/idle
froze. Baseline restored = the prior Animate (walk/idle/fire-reset OK; dive-legs read as crouch). The user
compared our 3rd person against the running original and reported (these are the requirements — VERIFY each via
a LIVE TRACE of the original's CTSAnimation::Animate, do NOT guess; guessing caused the regressions):
1. **Dive** reads as a crouch (the original complaint): dive_<dir> body (0x94 clears legs) is stomped by the
   per-frame PostThink Animate(1=RUN) one frame later. Needs a HOLD that does NOT depend on m_fSequenceFinished
   (likely the leg-timer the dive sets, m_flLegTimer=3.0, or an iuser4 stunt bit).
2. **Getup leaves the player DUCKED** — the unduck on dive-end isn't happening (likely TS_pm_shared stunt code,
   not Animate). Separate from the body sequence.
3. **Fire animation does NOT play in 3rd person** — PRE-EXISTING ("regardless"). SetAnimation(PLAYER_ATTACK1)
   DOES route to Animate(TSA_FIRE) which sets shoot_<grip> (0x92 force) + m_flAimTimer=2.0, so trace WHY the
   3rd-person model doesn't show it (sequence name wrong? server not advancing pev->sequence? overwritten?).
4. **Knife idle == kung-fu idle** (combat_idle) — so the knife's grip (m_szAnimExtention) should be EMPTY
   (kungfu path), not idle_<grip>. **Katana has a DEDICATED idle.** Fix is the per-weapon grip/anim-ext.
5. **Block animations:** kung-fu (fists), knives, AND katana all have BLOCK anims in the original (e.g. reload
   with kung-fu = block) — kungfu_block / knife_block / katana_block (TSA_CC_BLOCK 0x26 in HandleCloseCombat).
   The reload-while-melee should play the block, not relo_<grip>.
NEXT (focused, runtime-driven): live.py + binmap CTSAnimation::Animate on the running original; user reproduces
dive/fire/idle/block; read the activity arg + resulting pev->sequence/gaitsequence each call; THEN reconcile the
revert minimally (hold via leg-timer; knife/katana grips; melee block on reload) — verified, not guessed.

## CTSAnimation — LIVE-TRACE findings (original hl.exe, mp.dll) — CHANGES THE APPROACH
Traced the running original's `CTSAnimation::Animate` (binmap → mp.dll **0x44b50**; live base 0x1e12ffb0 →
abs 0x1e174b00; pid varies, re-find with `live.py pid`). gdb hardware-bp logging the `activity` arg
(`*(int*)($esp+8)`; __thiscall: this=ecx, pPlayer=[esp+4], activity=[esp+8]). Tooling + scripts in
`scratchpad/anim_probe.gdb` / `anim_trace.gdb`. KEY RESULT (multiple runs, incl. holding FIRE 8s):
**Animate is called per-frame with activity 0x6 (IDLE) / 0x1 (RUN) and essentially NOTHING ELSE.** Firing did
NOT produce Animate(TSA_FIRE=0); dive/melee/block codes (0x28/0x26/...) were not observed either.
**=> In the original, CTSAnimation::Animate is ONLY the locomotion (run/idle) dispatcher.** The 3rd-person
FIRE / stunt / melee body poses are set by a DIFFERENT mechanism, NOT Animate(activity). OUR build routes
`SetAnimation(PLAYER_ATTACK1) -> Animate(TSA_FIRE)` (player.cpp:962) and ts_stunt.cpp calls `Animate(0x28/...)`,
which DIVERGES from the original — this is why the 3rd-person fire anim doesn't match and why the stunt poses
fight the per-frame idle. NEXT (next session, runtime): find WHERE the original sets the player's body
sequence on fire/stunt — break on writes to the player entity's `pev->sequence` (or trace the weapon's
StandardFire / the stunt code) to see the real path; then re-route ours to match. Do NOT keep forcing it
through Animate(activity). (The `dossier-ctsanimation.md` Region-C body switch is real CODE in the .so, but
the live trace shows it's reached via a path other than the per-frame PostThink Animate(1/6) — find that caller.)

## CTSAnimation — LIVE-TRACE BREAKTHROUGH (the real model; fixes the whole approach)
Watched the original player's `pev->sequence` (entvars offset **296**; addr from an Animate hit:
pPlayer=[esp+4] → pev=*(pPlayer+4) → +296) while firing + diving. SEQUENCE CHANGES come from inside the LARGE
`CTSAnimation::Animate` (mp.dll 0x44b50) — writer return-addresses cluster at RVAs **0x453a8 / 0x4548e /
0x46023 / 0x461b2** (all inside Animate; nearest export is the unrelated CTriggerCamera::FollowTarget). Fire
body seqs ≈ 16/48/49/61/64 (multiple sites); DIVE body seqs ≈ 103/135/139/144 (from 0x461b2). **MODEL:
`Animate` is the SOLE per-frame body-pose setter — called every frame with ONLY idle(6)/run(1) — and it picks
the actual pose (shoot/dive/idle/…) INTERNALLY from player STATE.** The original NEVER makes external
`Animate(TSA_FIRE=0)` / `Animate(0x28)` calls (confirmed: held full-auto fire 8s → only act=6; the activity arg
is the LOCOMOTION mode, not the pose selector).
**=> OUR BUG:** we route `SetAnimation(PLAYER_ATTACK1)→Animate(TSA_FIRE)` (player.cpp:962) + ts_stunt.cpp
`Animate(0x28/...)`, and our Animate's Region-C switches on `activity`. That's backwards. The 3rd-person fire
pose likely never shows because the predicted-only fire path doesn't set the SERVER pev->sequence, and the
per-frame Animate(6) doesn't read the fire state to set shoot_.
**FIX (next session, with full context — substantial rework):** `dc.sh mp 0x44b50` (decompile the big mp.dll
Animate) — recover its INTERNAL state checks (how it detects "firing" / a stunt to pick shoot_/dive_ vs idle_),
then reconstruct OUR Animate to set the pose INTERNALLY each frame from player state, and REMOVE the external
Animate(TSA_FIRE)/Animate(0x28) routing. Verify by re-watching pev->sequence on OURS vs the original. gdb
scripts saved: scratchpad/{anim_probe,getseq,watchseq}.gdb; pev->sequence offset 296, gaitsequence 300.

## CTSAnimation — DECOMPILE (ts_i386.so, the right source) CORRECTS the live-trace conclusion
Decompiled the big `Animate` (.so 0x5b470→0x5d7e4, ~0x2374 bytes; raw in scratchpad/ctsanim-all.c lines
79-1206). **Ghidra renders `this->pev` but it's actually `m_iLastActivity` (field@0).** Structure:
- Region A (continue dive/jump blend), Region B `switch(m_iLastActivity)` (HOLD guards), Region C `switch(a1)`
  (set the NEW body pose), Region D (leg gait).
- **Region C case 0/8/9 = FIRE** → `shoot_`/`crouch_shoot_`+grip, sets `m_flAimTimer=2.0` (field_0xc). So fire
  IS an EXTERNAL Animate(0) call (my live-trace "no Animate(0)" was wrong — the hardware-bp probe missed the
  rare per-shot calls; case 0 is real, shipped, reached). **=> do NOT remove the external fire routing.**
- **Region C case 1/6 = RUN/IDLE = the per-frame STATE-DRIVEN pose:** (a) if `player+0x478` (a 2nd anim string)
  is NON-EMPTY → play it directly as the body seq; (b) elif grip(player+0xb58=m_szAnimExtention) empty → break
  (kungfu, body follows legs in D); (c) elif `m_iLastActivity ∈ {0,8,9,0x34,0x33}`(fire/draw/relo) && seq not
  finished → HOLD (a1=m_iLastActivity, break); (d) else `aim_`/`idle_`/`crouch_aim_`/`duck_idle_` by
  **`(m_flAimTimer>=0.01 || fov!=0)`** — NOT the attack button.
**player+0x478 is the key missing piece:** a per-frame anim-OVERRIDE string. Non-empty → Animate plays it as the
body. It's also HandleCloseCombat's block-type selector (kat/kni). This is what drives the user's knife-idle=kungfu
(knife sets grip EMPTY + 0x478="knife"), katana dedicated idle, and the melee BLOCK on reload. We DON'T model it.
Done (`d32261c`): aligned our case-1/6 aim_ to `(fov!=0)` (the m_flAimTimer branch is held above)
+ documented 0x478. NEXT: add `m_szAnimOverride` (player+0x478), find its SETTER in the .so (what writes it on
melee-deploy / block — decompile CTSGun deploy + the melee path), wire Animate case-1/6 to play it, and set it
empty-grip+override for knife/katana. THAT (not removing routing) is the faithful rebuild. The "fire anim doesn't
play" is likely a separate grip/sequence-name/server-exec detail — compare OUR pev->sequence on fire vs the
original (watchpoint, scripts saved) before more changes.

## CTSAnimation — player+0x478 anim-override IMPLEMENTED (`a9871ff`) — knife/katana dedicated idles
Found the SETTER: `CBasePlayerWeapon::DefaultDeploy@0x90178` writes player+0x478 for weapon id 16
(weapon_tsgun), switching on m_weaponType (gun+0xc8) — VERIFIED 1:1 vs our enum: KNIFE(25,0x19)/
SEALKNIFE(35,0x23)->"knife_idle", KATANA(34,0x22)->"katana_idle", FLAG(29,0x1d)->"briefcase_idle", else
cleared. Also written by `HolsterWeapon@0x75698`. Implemented: `m_szAnimOverride[16]` on CBasePlayer; set in
CTSGun::Deploy (the switch above); read FIRST in Animate's torso (non-empty -> SetAnim(override,0x12), the
dedicated idle). This is the "set the pose per-frame from state" half the goal asked for (the field_0x478
override is state the deploy sets, Animate reads each frame). NOTE: the goal's "remove the external routing"
premise was WRONG — the decompile shows fire legitimately uses an external Animate(0) (case 0 sets shoot_+
m_flAimTimer); kept it. STILL OPEN: fire-anim-3rd-person (#3, likely a grip/seq-name detail — needs OUR-build
pev->sequence watch vs original), the dive-hold (#1, leg-timer-gated, not m_fSequenceFinished), melee BLOCK on
reload (#5b — HandleCloseCombat uses player+0x478 for kat/kni block pick; now that we set 0x478 it's wireable).

## CTSAnimation — FIRING/DIVING DETECTION resolved + external routing removed (the goal, completed)
The live-trace "Animate is locomotion-only" was WRONG (the hardware-bp missed the calls). DECOMPILE ground truth
(dc.sh on the re project): **CBasePlayer::SetAnimation@0xd8f50 is an EMPTY no-op in TS.** The 34 callers of
Animate are the WEAPON + movement code calling it DIRECTLY with the activity: **CTSGun::Fire@0x71c78 computes
shootanim (0 standard / 8+racktoggle pump) and calls Animate(player, shootanim) directly** (StandardFire does
NOT); also KnifeFire/KatanaFire (melee codes), Reload, Deploy(DRAW), PM_Jump(4). So "firing detection" = the
weapon calls Animate with the fire activity directly; SetAnimation is empty (TS moved the anim logic into the
direct calls). REBUILT ours to match (commit pending): CTSGun::Fire now calls m_TSAnim.Animate(player,shootanim)
DIRECTLY (0/8/9) and the SetAnimation(PLAYER_ATTACK1) indirection was removed from StandardFire + AkimboFire.
This removes the external SetAnimation routing for the gun fire path (the goal). NET: gun fire still triggers
Animate(TSA_FIRE) → case 0 → shoot_<grip>, but now via the original's mechanism (and it runs on the client too,
where our SetAnimation may have been a stub — this may also be WHY the 3rd-person fire anim didn't show; PLAYTEST).
Still indirect (separate paths, lower priority): MeleeAttack/ColdCock SetAnimation (the knife/katana/coldcock
body — original uses KnifeFire/KatanaFire/ColdCock→Animate(melee codes)); PLAYER_WALK/IDLE/JUMP/DIE still route
through SetAnimation (original calls Animate directly from PostThink/PM_Jump — a fuller faithful refactor later).

## 2026-10-07 — fix round rets: speed events, ts_groundweapon ammo, kung fu caliber, rets_api v2
- Speed: PreThink no longer calls SetPlayerSpeed every frame. The original's 11 SetPlayerSpeed call sites
  (objdump of ts_i386.so) are TSInit, PickUpWeapon, DropWeapon, TakeArmor, TakeFlag, DropFlag, SetPlayerTheOne,
  KnifeFire, KatanaThrow, GrenadeIdle, MultiplyClips; reTS lacked TakeArmor/TakeFlag/DropFlag, now added.
  A plugin's maxspeed now holds until the next loadout event, as on TS 3.0.
- CTSGroundWeapon::GetWeapon (@0x92328): wextraclip rounds go to an EMPTY caliber reserve via AddAmmo (+ the
  9mmclip1 sound); ours gave one weapon clip (Glock: 17) whatever was asked.
- kCaliber[0] (kung fu) = 0 (Write_melee never writes +0x8); was 2, which showed caliber 2's reserve on the
  kung fu HUD.
- rets_api v2: GetWeaponOwned/SetWeaponOwned/GetWeaponClip/SetWeaponClip (s_weapon_status), used by reTSX for
  grenade/knife counts. Verified: amxxbench tsx_ammo + ts_speed tests, 12/12 on reTS (6 failed before) and on TS 3.0.
- Left: TakeArmor's 10-slot kevlar cost is still not modelled in TSPlayerFreeSlots/GetSpeedBySlots.

## 2026-10-07 — fix round rets2: kevlar's 10 slots, CTSGroundWeapon::GetWeapon details
- Kevlar slots: TakeArmor (@0x83da4) charges 10 free slots (player+0x548) when kevlar goes on, refunds them when
  it comes off, and refuses kevlar with fewer than 10 free (@0x83dfb: returns 0, no change, no speed update).
  TSPlayerFreeSlots now subtracts 10 for m_bHasKevlar and GetSpeedBySlots reads TSPlayerFreeSlots, so the pickup
  gate, throws, dives, GetAccelBySlots, TSSpace and rets_api GetFreeSlots all include it. TakeArmor returns bool.
- TakeArmor callers (objdump, 6 PLT calls): AddItem (loadout kevlar: refused = no vest), PlayerAddPowerUp (powerup
  used up anyway; reTS added armor directly, now calls TakeArmor), CTSAmmoPack::WaitTouch (pack armor zeroed
  anyway, as before), CRecharge::Use (@0xb71ec: empties the charger and calls TakeArmor(100); reTS charged +1 per
  tick), CItemBattery::MyTouch (battery used up anyway, as before), DropArmor (TakeArmor(-1) @0x83d8f; reTS zeroed
  armorvalue and kept m_bHasKevlar; DropArmor has no caller in the original).
- GetWeapon (@0x92328, disasm): PickUpWeapon gets the whole spawnflags (was & 0xF); the respawn schedule runs
  before the extra clips; a wduration < 1 weapon gets no respawn think in modes 2/3; pev->message goes out by
  TSHudMessageOne(0,0,0,8,30) (was HudText); the dead buy gate uses TSHudMessageOne(0,0,0,16,30), the 2/3 mode
  test, base price + magazine price per extra clip, and charges after the pickup.
- Verified: amxxbench plugins/tests/ts_pickups.test.sma (AMX Mod X tsx-ts3 worktree) 4/4 fail on the old build,
  pass after; ts30/ts_pickups.test.sma 4/4 on TS 3.0; tsx_ammo + ts_speed still 12/12. amd64 + i386 build.
- Not runtime-tested (unreachable from a plugin): the refund (DropArmor is dead), modes 2/3, the charger, whole
  spawnflags (TakeWeapon clamps the new item's attach; only an akimbo combine's single keeps extra bits).
- Also: CItemBattery::MyTouch needs the suit (pev->weapons sign test @0xbb788), now checked; PlayerAddPowerUp's
  pickup sound is CHAN_ITEM (@0x87dd9), was CHAN_VOICE.

## 2026-10-07 — rets_api v3 for reTSX; ammocount, superjump powerup, freeze, knife slow motion
- rets_api v3: bullet time (0x175), kung fu (0x74e), superjump (0x74f), GetSpeedBySlots/SetPlayerSpeed, ammo
  max carry, and a working SetFreeSlots (CBasePlayer::m_iFreeSlotsAdjust, not in the original, cleared in TSInit).
- CTSGameRules::Think (@0x67323): a powerup not yet due skips only the spawn; the SrvSett tail (Set_ammo_count)
  runs every frame. Before, a new ammocount waited for the next powerup spawn (up to 20 s).
- CTSPowerUp::SetupPowerUp (@0x88047): an explicit superjump is re-rolled only in map superjump mode.
- GoSlow(0) freezes as in the original: PreThink keeps fuser1 at 1.0 only while the target is not 0, and
  PM_PlayerMove freezes below 0.1, 0 included (@0xf0928). Also in client.so; not run in a graphical client.
- CTSKnife derives from CTSGrenade (hierarchy.tsv); Spawn/WaitThink run CTSPhysicObject's, so slow motion
  slows thrown knives. hamdata output unchanged.
- Verified by AMX Mod X tsx-ts3 cd6943c1/0e34a793 tests on reTS (tsx_player, tsx_ammo).

## 2026-10-07 — powerup inside a player's box: no reTS difference, nothing changed
- Question: a ts_powerup set at a standing player's origin never lands on reTS; the ts30 TSX test drops one there
  and passes on TS 3.0. CTSPowerUp Spawn (@0x88258), Fall (@0x883cc), OnGround (@0x8848c) match ts_powerup.cpp
  (TOSS/BBOX, zero size, 0.1 s Fall think, FL_ONGROUND -> OnGround, trigger -16 -16 0 / 16 16 64). The global
  ShouldCollide (@0x9b7b4) only reaches CBaseEntity::ShouldCollide (return 1) for player vs powerup.
  Server_GetBlendingInterface (@0x93f80) installs a stub SV_StudioSetupBones (@0x93fdc, only alerts) but returns
  0, so the engine resets to its own bone setup: player hitboxes are the engine's on both, as reTS (no export).
- Measured with an amxxbench probe on both stacks: a point powerup inside the player's hitboxes is allsolid and
  never lands, on TS 3.0/HLDS exactly as on reTS/ReHLDS (forced to ts_lobby 784 0 113: stuck on both; the ts30
  superjump test fails on TS 3.0 from there too). The ts30 test passes only because the player is still falling
  from a spawn spot 25-33 units over the floor; ts_lobby's 784 0 112 spot is 13 over and fails on both.
- No reTS change. The reTS test's +48-after-settle placement stays; its comments now give the real reason.
  Report: ~/Projects/amxxbench/docs/fixes/rets-powerup-report.md.
- Still a deliberate deviation: slow-pause self rate 0.6 (ts_player.cpp UpdatePowerUpState); the ts30 test
  measures 0.8 on TS 3.0, which settles the "live-trace to pin it" note there.

## 2026-10-07 — `kill` arms a one-second timer, as the original
- ClientKill (@0x9cec8) only arms player+0x84c (the SDK's m_fNextSuicideTime slot, between m_afPhysicsFlags 0x848
  and m_flTimeStepSound 0x850) to time + 1.0 (rodata 0xf6a14), unless pev->iuser1 is set or it is already armed
  (> 0.001, rodata 0xf6a1c). No deadflag gate, no rate limit. The end of CBasePlayer::PreThink (@0x815b6) kills
  once it is armed and below gpGlobals->time: disarm, health 0, Killed(pev, GIB_NEVER) through vtable +0x60
  (attacker = the player's own pev, as the SDK's ClientKill). The game-over, spectator (iuser1), dead
  (deadflag > 0 -> PlayerDeathThink) and train-release returns skip it. TSInit (@0x82ef3, called only from Spawn)
  clears it. objdump finds no other reader or writer of 0x84c.
- reTS: dlls/client.cpp ClientKill arms m_fNextSuicideTime; dlls/player.cpp PreThink tail carries it out;
  dlls/ts_player.cpp TSInit clears it; dlls/player.h comment. amd64 and i386 build.
- Verified with an amxxbench probe on reTS amd64 and TS 3.0: alive right after kill and at +0.5 s (second kill
  does not re-arm), dead after 1.008 s (TS 3.0 1.002 s); a kill while spectating or dead does not kill after
  the next spawn; a new kill right after a respawn lands a second later.
- Tests that assumed the instant kill now wait for the death (Apollo-RP, the AMX Mod X fork, amxxbench docs).
  Report: ~/Projects/amxxbench/docs/fixes/rets-kill-report.md.
- Found, not changed: the `jointeam` dispatch (@0x9e4b0) passes atoi(argv1) - 1 (dec at 0x9e4f5) to
  GetIndexedTeamName; reTS (client.cpp jointeam) passes atoi(argv1). On ts_lobby a plmenu "jointeam 1" leaves
  the player alive on TS 3.0 but sends him to spectate at once on reTS.

## 2026-10-07 — five user-directed deviations put back to the original
Each is a separate patch against f92c74e in ~/stignored/rets-deviations/item{1..5}-*.patch, for Steven to keep
or drop one by one. Report: ~/Projects/amxxbench/docs/fixes/rets-deviations-report.md.
- 1 slow-pause: UpdatePowerUpState (@0x857d0) sets the self scale 0.8 (0x3f4ccccd) and others 0.225; reTS
  had slow motion's 0.6. dlls/ts_player.cpp. TS 3.0 measures 0.8; the reTS tsx_player test now expects it.
- 2 sawed-off reload: CTSGun::Reload computes block[8] for a loaded sawed-off and discards it; the event's
  fparam1 is always 0 (@0x74eeb). client.dll's reload handler (FUN_10042690) reads block[8] only for phase 8,
  and no other client.dll path reads the sawed-off's block[8] (the 7 FUN_1003df60 callers, the 12
  EV_WeaponAnimation calls, the 2 HUD_SendWeaponAnim calls; no client copy of CTSGun::Reload). reTS sends
  phase 0 again (dlls/ts_gun.cpp); its client handler already matched. Probe: fparam1 0.0 on TS 3.0 and reTS
  now, 8.0 with the old build.
- 3 dropped-gun glow: only the flag (0x1d) gets pev renderfx 19 (@0x90902). AddToFullPack (@0x9f4b8) sends a
  WorldGun with renderamt 2, renderfx 19, colour 100 to the host stored at gun+0xd0, which DropWeapon sets to
  the dropper's edict on a drop-key/disarm drop (@0x84ed9, 0x84fad, 0x85265; not drop_<N>, not the flag, not a
  death drop). reTS: CTSWorldGun::m_pDropper, DropWeapon tail, AddToFullPack branch. The same branch glows a
  thrown knife for knife+0x8c (its thrower, CreateKnife @0x6da4f); not done. Also not done: the same DropWeapon
  tail sets gun+0xc4 = time + clamp(2 * weaponstay, 10, 120).
- 4 powerup cheat: the table (jump table GOT-0xc8264) is 1 slow-pause, 2 PickUpWeapon(M61), 3 kung fu AND
  superjump (each with its PwUp message), 4 MultiplyClips, 5 double fire, anything else slow motion; gated on
  g_flWeaponCheat (sv_cheats, read in CWorld::Spawn) and argc > 1 before the strcmp falls through, then alive
  and pev->iuser1 == 0. reTS's case 3 was health and 6/7 were added; now TSPowerupCheat (dlls/ts_powerup.cpp),
  gate in client.cpp (live g_psv_cheats, as cashala).
- 5 jointeam: g_pGameRules->GetIndexedTeamName(atoi - 1) then ChangePlayerTeam(pl, name, 0, 0), both virtual,
  no checks. The kill round's "alive on TS 3.0" came from the stock copies running deathmatch (game.cfg has
  //mp_teamplay 1) while the reTS copies run teamplay; in teamplay TS 3.0 also sends the player to spectate.

## 2026-10-07 — five more places put back to the original (thrown knife, drop lifetime, slow on create, powerup state, cheat latch)
Each is a separate patch against e4a1f85 in ~/stignored/rets-deviations2/item{1..5}-*.patch (apply-all.sh applies
them in order; item3 needs -C1 after item1). Report: ~/Projects/amxxbench/docs/fixes/rets-deviations2-report.md.
- 1 thrown knife: CreateKnife (@0x6da4f) keeps the thrower at knife+0x8c and never sets pev->owner; BounceTouch
  skips and credits him through it (@0x6df18, @0x6e0b3); AddToFullPack (@0x9f52a..0x9f59a) draws the knife with
  renderamt 2, glow shell, colour 100 for him alone. reTS: CTSKnife::m_pThrower, TSKnifeThrower bridge, the
  AddToFullPack branch. The settled-blade pev glow (ledger playtest round 3, user-directed) is kept.
- 2 drop lifetime: DropWeapon's type < 0 sites (@0x84e76, @0x84f4a, @0x85200) set gun+0xc4 = time +
  clamp(2 * weaponstay, 10, 120) beside the dropper; reTS TSMarkDropKeyGun (dlls/ts_gun.cpp).
- 3 create: CreateWeapon sets no skin and calls GoSlow (vtable +0x14) with owner+0x180 (m_flSlowMotionRamp) when
  non-zero, else owner->GiveSlowMul(). The same inlined test is in CreateKnife, CreateGrenade and CreateFlag;
  all four now use TSThrowSlow (dlls/ts_player.cpp). CreateFlag's no-owner branch clears pev->owner, not iuser1.
- 4 powerup state: UpdatePowerUpState (@0x85748) sets gravity 0.15 each frame for a running 0x100 and 1.0 when it
  ends; a dead player's running (@0x858a5) or held (@0x85928) powerup is CreatePowerUp'd at his origin unless
  rules+0 > 1 or it is slow motion of 2 s or less. Only death re-drops; expiry while alive does not.
- 5 cheats: g_flWeaponCheat = sv_cheats in CWorld::Spawn (@0xe448f), read by fov, powerup, cashala (compared only
  when set, else "Unknown command"), CheatImpulseCommands, InitHUD's notice, dmgreport and damagemult. reTS
  had halflife-updated's live g_psv_cheats reads; now the latch (dlls/game.h, world.cpp).
- Tests (AMX Mod X tsx-ts3 worktree): ts_drop_glow (knife), ts_dropped, ts_powerup_state, ts_cheats; all 10 new
  fail on the e4a1f85 build, pass with the patches and on TS 3.0. Builds amd64/i386 server+client.
- Found, not changed: reTS ColdCock multiplies damage by damagemult without the cheat gate (the original reads
  damagemult only in UpdateBullet and ShootBulletsPlayer); reTS's UpdateBullet and knife BounceTouch lack the
  original's cheat-gated dmgreport/damagemult; reTS PreThink returns for a spectate-waiting player before
  UpdatePowerUpState/SlowMotionFlow (the original runs them); TSX's knife hit attribution reads knife+0x8c by
  pointer index 35, which is not reTS's layout on amd64.

## 2026-10-07 — seven more places put back to the original (join, pev->team, shimmer, damage cvars, knife thrower)
Each is a separate patch against f05c6e8 in ~/stignored/rets-deviations3/item{1..7}-*.patch (apply-all.sh applies
them in order). Report: ~/Projects/amxxbench/docs/fixes/rets-deviations3-report.md.
- 1 join: ClientPutInServer (@0x9cf44) is SetCustomDecalFrames, GiveCash(initial_cash), Spawn, EF_NOINTERP; the
  joiner spectates from CTSGameRules::InitHUD's StartObserver (@0x694c8) on his first UpdateClientData, with
  SetPlayerRespawnTime unconditional (@0x6956b). reTS: no spectate flag, cash zeroing or iuser reset in
  ClientPutInServer; InitHUD ends with TSEnterSpectate (gate cleared first). MP::PlayerSpawn's RemoveAllItems shim
  now runs only when the player holds the tsgun: RemoveAllItems ends in UpdateClientData, which ran a joiner's
  InitHUD inside ClientPutInServer (the original's PlayerSpawn @0x790ac strips nothing).
- 2 pev->team: never written by the original (only CWorld::KeyValue @0xe4ca2 stores entvars+0x1ac; @0x898d3 is
  takedamage). StartObserver's and ChangePlayerTeam's writes removed; CTSBomb::Use and CTSTrigger::WaitTouch take
  the team from TeamID() via CTSGameRules::GetTeamIndex, as CanInteract @0x7c344 and WaitTouch @0x60b5c do.
- 3 shimmer: TSInit renderfx 14 (kRenderFxNoDissipation, @0x82b83); PreThink's clear moved past the spectator,
  observer and dead returns (@0x81458), so a spectator keeps it.
- 4 ColdCock: no damagemult (only ShootBulletsPlayer and UpdateBullet read it).
- 5 UpdateBullet: cheat-gated damagemult except kind 2 (@0x5f256, @0x5f1c9) and dmgreport "damage:%f" (@0x5f317);
  knife BounceTouch dmgreport "(debug)%f" with the stab damage (@0x6dffe); every dmgreport print is print talk (3),
  ShootBulletsPlayer's were notify. The original never registers dmgreport (no GOT entry or reference to its
  cvar_t); reTS registers it (ts_cvars.cpp), so these prints are reachable on reTS only. Not changed.
- 6 PreThink: UpdatePowerUpState/SlowMotionFlow run before the spectate block (@0x80bb1), so a spectator's powerup
  is re-dropped.
- 7 rets_api v4 GetKnifeThrower (dlls/rets_api.{h,cpp}); TSX (tsx-ts3 worktree) uses it on reTS.
- Tests (AMX Mod X tsx-ts3 worktree): new ts_join, ts_damage, ts_powerup_state +1; 8 of the new tests fail on
  f05c6e8 (the knife-hit test was not run on the old TSX: index 35 reads past the 216-byte amd64 CTSKnife), all 12
  pass after and on TS 3.0 (deathmatch; ts_join also in teamplay). Builds amd64/i386 server+client. Fork
  stats_logging and plmenu's two team-menu tests assumed the old join and now hold on both games; full fork
  suite on reTS 440/441 (statscfg folder write, as before).
- Found, not changed: TSEnterSpectate forces OBS_ROAMING (iuser1 3); the original's StartObserver uses
  m_iObserverLastMode or 2 (a TS 3.0 joiner has iuser1 2).

## 2026-10-07 — three more places put back to the original (observer mode, round-clock catch-up, PreThink order)
Each is a separate patch against 64d810b in ~/stignored/rets-deviations4/item{1..3}-*.patch (apply-all.sh applies
them in order). Report: ~/Projects/amxxbench/docs/fixes/rets-deviations4-report.md.
- 1 observer mode: StartObserver ends with Observer_SetMode(lastMode ? lastMode : 2) (@0x8999d); the only store to
  player+0x76c is StopObserver saving iuser1 (@0x89a6f). reTS: StartObserver falls back to OBS_CHASE_FREE,
  TSEnterSpectate no longer forces roaming, StopObserver saves iuser1, UCD's stock lastMode = OBS_ROAMING removed.
  A joiner (and a dead player) chases a live player, as on TS 3.0.
- 2 CTSGameRules::InitHUD: the round-clock catch-up has no g_teamplay gate (@0x6931f), so a last man standing
  joiner gets RoundTime.
- 3 PreThink: UpdatePlayerState and the mode-3 CheckForWires moved after the fall velocity (@0x81416, @0x81450), past
  the spectator, dead and train returns.
- Tests (AMX Mod X tsx-ts3 worktree): new ts_observer (5); 4 fail on 64d810b, all pass after and on TS 3.0 (DM and
  teamplay). Builds amd64/i386 server+client. Full fork suite on reTS 445/446 (statscfg folder write, as before).
- Found, not changed: the spectate block lacks the original's Observer_HandleButtons/Observer_Idle (@0x810c3);
  Observer_SetMode/FindNextPlayer/Idle are stock, not the original's (no prints, team filter, fallbacks); InitHUD
  message order and the clock's rounding (original truncates); RestartRound's player-count/mode gates and banner;
  last man standing rounds never resolve on reTS (ResetRestartRound reads the unregistered "lms" cvar, CheckDeads
  needs teamplay); PreThink's +0x7cc kick block is dead in the original.

## 2026-10-07 — spectator controls, observer functions, last man standing rounds, InitHUD clock, RestartRound
Each is a separate patch against 8918bb2 in ~/stignored/rets-deviations5/item{1..5}-*.patch (apply-all.sh applies
them in order). Report: ~/Projects/amxxbench/docs/fixes/rets-deviations5-report.md.
- 1 PreThink: the spectate-wait block and the stock IsObserver block end with Observer_HandleButtons +
  Observer_Idle (@0x810c3, @0x810cb); Observer_CheckTarget/CheckProperties (absent in the original) are no longer
  called, still defined.
- 2 observer.cpp: FindNextPlayer (@0x89b0c) skips dead players, takes teammates only in modes 2/3 or LMS while the
  spectator's respawn time is >= 0, always sets iuser2 and moves him, roams with nobody. SetMode (@0x89e44) prints
  nothing, stores no last mode, roaming sets max speed 420. HandleButtons (@0x89d34) reads held buttons: jump
  3->2->1->5->3, forward/back next/previous. Idle (@0x89ca4) has its own 0.5 s clock m_flNextObserverIdle (0x764,
  zeroed in StartObserver) and also moves on when the target spectates.
- 3 CheckDeads reconstructed (@0x69c00): returns in mode 1; LMS block (Last Man Standing +10 frags, ScoreInfo, log,
  RoundTime flag 2, restart in 3 s; "%d men standing!"; "Round over"); modes 2/3 team block. ResetRestartRound's
  gate is modes 2/3 or g_lastManStanding (@0x68763), not the unregistered "lms" cvar.
- 4 InitHUD: the round clock goes out before the Spectator catch-up and is truncated.
- 5 RestartRound: no player-count or game-mode gate; banner only in mode 2.
- Tests (AMX Mod X tsx-ts3 worktree): ts_observer +4, new ts_rounds (4). TS 3.0 17/17 (DM and teamplay); reTS
  8918bb2 10/17, after 16/17. The failing one, "last man standing ends the round", cannot run on reTS: nobody can
  enter play in LMS (below); with that one line fixed in a verification build it passes (fails on 8918bb2 + the
  same line). Full fork suite on reTS 451/454: statscfg folder write (as before), that LMS test, and the flaky
  tsx_player "thrown knife" (fails 1 in 3 on 8918bb2 too).
- Found, not changed: SetPlayerRespawnTime (TS_gamerules.cpp:168) and five more sites use
  dynamic_cast<CTSGameRules *>(g_pGameRules), always null since CTSGameRules is standalone, so in LMS every
  respawn gate is ~0 and the "respawn" command never lets anyone in; the same dead cast drops realbullet in
  ShootBulletsPlayer, the superjump map global, the disconnect's CallCheckDeads/vote reset and team spawn points.
  Also: RestartRound respawns where the original StartObservers + refunds; StartObserver resets the input clock and
  StopObserver clears the target (the original does neither); the spectate block does not clear impulse;
  CallCheckDeads does not re-arm; the restartround command is missing; banner colours; InitHUD's damage notice
  needs cheats in the original; TS 3.0 runs a joiner's InitHUD catch-up three times.

## 2026-10-07 — game-rules lookups, new round, restartround, spectate details, banners, InitHUD passes
Each is a separate patch against 3b6dee8 in ~/stignored/rets-deviations6/item{1,3..8}-*.patch (apply-all.sh).
Report: ~/Projects/amxxbench/docs/fixes/rets-deviations6-report.md.
- 1 The six dynamic_cast<CTSGameRules *>(g_pGameRules) (always null) read TSGameRules, as the original's GOT
  pointer: SetPlayerRespawnTime, ShootBulletsPlayer (realbullet), CTSMapGlobals::Spawn and TSInit (superjump),
  TSPlayerDisconnect (vote block at reTS's ENTINDEX-1 index, CallCheckDeads), EntSelectSpawnPoint (rewritten to
  @0x66128: IsTeamplay gate, TeamID, info_player_team<N> with fallback info_player_deathmatch, "" for an unknown
  team, none outside teamplay). Init clears m_bSrvSuperJump (@0x67ec2). No other such lookup in the tree.
- 3 RestartRound per player (@0x67a4d): hold/gate/award/grenade buys/respawn budget/powerups, loadout refund off
  the TS gun (prices, attachments 900/800/500/1800, magazines past one), StartObserver for players in play
  (TSEnterSpectate(false) keeps the loadout); RecountTeams on team rules (public now).
- 4 `restartround` server command = ResetRestartRound(2) (@0xb5748).
- 5 StartObserver keeps m_flNextObserverInput; StopObserver keeps m_hObserverTarget; the spectate-wait block
  clears pev->impulse (@0x810d3); CallCheckDeads re-arms on every death (@0x69bc0).
- 6 "Defeat the opposite team" / "Restarting Round" are black. 7 The damage notice is inside the cheats test.
- 8 UpdateClientData's HUD-reset block sends the RoundTime catch-up on every pass (@0x81e47).
- Tests: new ts_gamerules (5), ts_rounds +6, ts_observer +3, tsx_player knife made deterministic (stuck knife
  takes gravity 0.75 back); TS 3.0 27/27 (DM and teamplay). reTS realbullet still fails: UpdateBullet drops any
  bullet whose shooter is not slowed (the original does not), passes with that removed in a verification build.
- Found, not changed: that UpdateBullet drop; UpdateClientData's 0.1 s throttle (player+0x534); the original
  InitTeams' Team1..Team4 names and spot strings; Init clearing +0x5884; GetRandomPowerup and the HUD-reset
  TSPowerUp using the superjump flag; ts_mapglobals' round-timer and restriction push; the vote subsystem
  (slowmatch votes, InitHUD clearing the joiner's block, ENTINDEX indexing); StopObserver's gate and
  conditional Spectator message; RestartRound arming the clock before InitObjectives; addbot/addcustombot.

## 2026-10-07 — bullets fly on, vote clock, UpdateClientData throttle, ts_mapglobals, teams, votes, StopObserver
Each is a separate patch against 204ede8 in ~/stignored/rets-deviations7/item{1..12}-*.patch (apply-all.sh;
each also builds alone). Report: ~/Projects/amxxbench/docs/fixes/rets-deviations7-report.md.
- 1 UpdateBullet (@0x5ef5c) no longer drops a bullet whose shooter is not slowed: realbullet bullets now hit.
- 2 Init sets the vote count clock to time + 10 (@0x67e6d): the rules object outlives the map, so after a long
  map the count waited for the old map's time and a passed vote never ended the map (round 6's full-run failure).
- 3 UpdateClientData runs at most every 0.1 s (player+0x534 = m_flNextClientUpdate, @0x81d1f); 0 in TSInit and
  ForceClientDllUpdate, -1 for a leaver (TSPlayerDisconnect).
- 4 GetRandomPowerup leaves superjump out on a superjump map (@0x878d3); the HUD reset sends PwUp(0x100, 0) to a
  player with superjump there (@0x81ef6). g_iNoLowGravPowerup is gone.
- 5 CTSMapGlobals::Spawn pushes the round-timer flag (!(SF & 0x20)) and the restriction (get_weapon_restriction ->
  m_iWeaponRestriction and m_iAllowedCategories); Init resets both to InitWeaponRestriction().
- 6 Init clears m_bWeaponParamsCustom (+0x5884, @0x67ebb).
- 7 InitTeams: Team1..Team4, spot "info_player_team<N>" + fallback "info_player_deathmatch" in the team record
  (m_teamSpot/m_teamSpotFallback, read by EntSelectSpawnPoint), defTeamModels, up to 3 models per team
  (m_teamModels[4][3][16]; the per-team setter splits on ";" and ALERTs "set model"), GetPlayerModel picks one at
  random. Team cash seeding left out (see the report: GetTeamCash's gate differs).
- 8 Votes: a 0x48-byte VoteBlock per ENTINDEX (m_votes[32]: map[64], slowmatch/teamplay/friendlyfire bytes, owner),
  player 32 has none; CheckVotes in the original's order (slowmatch, friendly fire, teamplay -> "nextmap", map),
  its clear of the last counted player only; Init and InitHUD clear the blocks; reset writes the owner.
- 9 StopObserver: nothing while the respawn gate is ahead; Spectator(idx, 0) and the kept mode only when iuser1 or
  iuser2 is set. It still clears PFLAG_OBSERVER/iuser3/m_iHideHUD (reTS's StartObserver hides the HUD).
- 10 RestartRound arms and sends the clock before InitObjectives/SetObjective (@0x67a14).
- 11 addbot / addcustombot server commands: ALERT "Bots only in listen servers." (@0xb5520/@0xb5550), registered
  first in GameDLLInit.
- 12 EntSelectSpawnPoint returns the world without the ALERT.
- Tests (tsx-ts3 worktree, tests.patch): ts_gamerules +6 and 4 extended, ts_rounds +1 and the clock test tightened,
  ts_observer +1, stats kill flags spaced 0.15 s (TSX counts a kill from the victim's TSHealth). TS 3.0 34/35
  (realbullet's first, realbullet 0 shot missed once; 5/5 alone); reTS 204ede8 23/35,
  after 35/35. Full fork suite on reTS twice: only statscfg "save into a folder".
- Found, not changed (report): UpdateBullet's stepping (Think's per-bullet 0.1/(realbullet+1) s steps), slow
  source, pierce, no ricochet/decal, no range limit; Init's armor_absorb 0.2125 / health_absorb 0.1 and bullet
  reset; GetTeamCash's mode 2/3 gate; SetTeamList's dedup; Host_Say votes gated on IsAlive (original IsNetClient);
  PlayerVote parsing; the respawn command's iuser1 gate; StartObserver's HideHUD; ts_mapglobals' WaitThink.

## 2026-10-07 — kevlar values, bullet steps and hits, team cash, team list, votes, respawn gate, observer HUD, ts_mapglobals think

Round 8 of the deviations work (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations8.md, report rets-deviations8-report.md).
Uncommitted on 6bcafda; one patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations8 (each applies and builds alone,
apply-all.sh applies them in order).
- 4 Init sets health_absorb 0.1 (+0x5888) and armor_absorb 0.2125 (+0x588c) on every map (@0x67ede/@0x67ee8).
- 5 CBulletManager::Think (@0x5ec7c) gives each bullet its own next-update time: with realbullet 0/1 (unsigned
  m_iSrvRealBullet < 2) every 0.1/(realbullet+1) s, the step covering that interval; otherwise every frame by
  frametime. The slow factor is m_flSlowMotionRamp, else GiveSlowMul (taken at fire and at each step).
- 6 UpdateBullet hits (@0x5f0f5..0x5f498): the record's kind is the shot's mode (FireBullet's last argument,
  ShootBulletsPlayer's iMode); mode 1 adds DMG bit 25; the bullet pierces as the hitscan does (damage times
  flFactor2, halved through a player, over 5 and mode not 1/2: on from min(left, 48) past the hit unless solid, as
  mode 2); no ricochet sound, no decal, no end for range or solid while flying.
- 7 InitTeams seeds each team's score 0 and cash initial_cash (@0x67fba); GetTeamCash answers only in modes 2/3.
- 8 SetTeamList keeps a repeated name in its own slot (no lookup, @0x681ec).
- 9 Host_Say passes "vote" text from any client (IsNetClient, @0x9d4b2); PlayerVote takes the first word after
  "map" and compares it with the map case-sensitively; "vote stats" lists the last count's tally
  ("(%i/%i) votes for %s"), now kept in the rules (m_voteMaps/m_voteMapCount/on-off counters/m_iVotants,
  +0xf88..+0x1820) and refilled by each CheckVotes.
- 10 The "respawn" command checks iuser1 (@0x9da2a).
- 11 StartObserver leaves m_iHideHUD alone; StopObserver no longer clears it (neither writes it in the original).
- 12 CTSMapGlobals::Spawn sets no think (think and touch zeroed, nextthink time + 10, @0x625b1..0x625df).
- TS 3.0 crash of round 7 diagnosed from its core (systemd-coredump): RestartRound @0x67d40 calls
  CHalfLifeTeamplay::RecountTeams on g_pGameRules in every mode; in free-for-all last man standing that is a
  12-byte CHalfLifeMultiplay, and RecountTeams writes 0 to +0x214, which in that run was the `next` of an AMX Mod X
  language hash list head (g_pGameRules 0x9da0220, head 0x9da0430). reTS already calls it only on team rules.
- Tests (tsx-ts3 worktree, tests.patch): ts_gamerules +7 and realbullet tightened, ts_observer +1 and one
  extended, ts30 copies without the free-for-all last man standing tests (NO_FFA_LMS), statscfg's expected error
  in both forms. TS 3.0 31/31 five times; reTS 6bcafda 34/42, after 42/42; full fork suite on reTS 483/483 twice.

## 2026-10-07 — bullets reset per map, kevlar hit groups, falloff truncation, full-ring warning, The One team list, ts_mapglobals fields, HideWeapon, StopObserver

Round 9 of the deviations work (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations9.md, report rets-deviations9-report.md).
Uncommitted on 594b9e6; one patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations9 (each applies and builds alone,
apply-all.sh applies them in order).
- 1 Init calls CBulletManager::Reset (@0x67e83); Reset (@0x5ec50) zeroes the slots and frees nothing (the old map's
  sprite handles are stale, and could name new-map entities).
- 2 Kevlar absorbs only for hit groups 2..5 (@0x7fc17); armor_absorb capped at 1, no lower clamp.
- 3 The range falloff index is truncated (fistp, chop) at all four sites (@0x5f93c, @0x5fdbb, @0x5f1ad, @0x5f23d).
- 4 FireBullet with no free slot prints "WARNING:cannot create bullet!\n" to all, talk (@0x5edf8).
- 5 SetTeamList in The One mode: "The ONE" replaces the list's first name in slot 0 (@0x681ae), printed as a team.
- 6 CTSMapGlobals::Spawn zeroes think and touch only (the +0xc..+0x18 writes); player_respawn_num (+0x64) and
  player_at_a_time_num (+0x68) are kept; invented m_field14/m_field18 removed.
- 7 PreThink no longer writes HIDEHUD_FLASHLIGHT (the original never writes m_iHideHUD there).
- 8 StopObserver clears iuser1/iuser2 inside the observer block only; no PFLAG_OBSERVER/iuser3/m_afButtonPressed.
- Tests (tsx-ts3 worktree, tests.patch): ts_gamerules +6, ts_observer +1 and the HUD test requires no bits; ts30
  copies. reTS before 41/49, after 49/49; TS 3.0 matches after on every item. Full fork suite on reTS 490/490
  twice; the ts30 set 94/94 twice (runs 3 and 4; runs 1 and 2 each had one flake in an older test, see report).
- Found, not changed: bubble counts still rounded; ts_mapglobals save order (respawn_num first in the original);
  members_re.tsv rows for CTSMapGlobals stale.

## 2026-10-08 — bubble counts truncated, ts_mapglobals save order, members_re rows

Round 10 of the deviations work (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations10.md, report rets-deviations10-report.md).
Uncommitted on a8fbbec; one patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations10 (each applies and builds alone,
apply-all.sh applies them in order).
- 4 UTIL_BubbleTrail counts are truncated at both ShootBulletsPlayer sites (fistp, chop: @0x5fa85, @0x5fffb); the
  volley's product is taken in double (the original's is on the x87 stack).
- 5 CTSMapGlobals declares and saves player_respawn_num (+0x64) before player_at_a_time_num (+0x68), as the save
  table @0x1011a0 does (amd64 pdata 39 and 40 now).
- 6 members_re.tsv: the two stale CTSMapGlobals rows (0x10, 0x18: the second words of the think and touch member
  pointers) removed; a fresh curate_members.py run would also add four CBasePlayer rows (not taken).
- TS 3.0 LMS patch (amxxbench tests/patch-ts30.py) on every TS 3.0 server copy; the ts30 last man standing tests
  run again. Tests: realbullet placement fixed on ts_lobby, superjump gravity read after PreThink, a bubble test.
- Found, not changed: the original's PostThink sets pev->gravity = 1.0 whenever the player is on the ground
  (@0x8186f); reTS has no such write.

## 2026-10-08 — PostThink resets gravity on the ground

Final-stretch round (amxxbench docs/fixes/final-stretch.md). PostThink sets pev->gravity = 1.0 for a player on the
ground every frame, as the original does (@0x8186f: `testb $0x2,0x1a5(%eax)` = FL_ONGROUND, then
`movl $0x3f800000,0x11c(%eax)`), so a gravity a plugin or anything else lowered lasts only until he lands; the
superjump powerup sets 0.15 again in each PreThink. Test: ts_powerup_state "landing gives normal gravity back"
(tsx-ts3, reTS and ts30 copies): TS 3.0 pass; reTS before 0.5 after landing, after 1.0.

## 2026-10-08 — TSX sees hits and deaths on reTS: dmg_take kept, Killed sends TSHealth

Final-stretch round, found while checking 64bit's TSX fixes (ids, stats, stunts, scoring, The One) on reTS
with reTS copies of the ts30 tsx tests. TSX counts a hit or a death in its TSHealth handler from the victim's
dmg_take/dmg_inflictor, and clears dmg_take itself.
- UpdateClientData: the stock damage block is gone. The original's UpdateClientData @0x81d00 writes neither
  entvars+0x1d8/0x1dc (dmg_take/dmg_save) nor player+0x9b0 (m_bitsHUDDamage) and masks no damage bits; reTS
  cleared dmg_take before its TSHealth went out, so TSX on reTS saw no hit and no kill at all.
- Killed sends TSHealth 0 where the stock SDK sends Health (@0x7f3fb: TSHealth with player+0x9e0 after setting it
  to 0; the original sends Health and Battery nowhere, their only GOT uses are in LinkUserMessages). So the death
  reaches TSX in the frame of the kill, after the DeathMsg, as on TS 3.0.
Tests (tsx-ts3): reTS copies of ts30/tsx_weapons (newcomer test left out, below) and ts30/tsx_stats: before 3 of
17 pass (only the three id tests), after 16 of 16 on reTS, in deathmatch and teamplay.
Found, not changed: PlayerKilled has none of the original's streak scoring (double kill within 2 s, the
specialist's +5, the unstoppable doubling, streak/last-kill bytes +0x744/+0x748); The One is never crowned
(SelectRandomTheOne is gated on a cvar "the_one" the original does not have, and the crown changes no team);
CTSGun::UpdateClientData sends a newcomer a WeaponInfo (the original's change check compares only type +0x97a
and reserve +0x9b4, both reset to 0); UpdateClientData's TSHealth rounds where the original truncates
(player+0x9e0 cache); Killed sends CurWeapon where the original sends TSActiveItems.

## 2026-10-08 — streak scoring, The One, and three message differences, as the original

Round 11 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations11.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations11.
- 1 PlayerKilled scores streaks as @0x795e4: m_iKillStreak (+0x744, up to 255, every kill of a player by a
  player) and m_flLastKillTime (+0x748), both cleared in TSInit; double kill under 2.0 s (x2, the time then
  forgotten), +5 for a victim with 9 or more, x2 for a killer at 10 or more, in that order; the 3/6/9 tiers
  (health, award 2/3/4, the specialist's kung fu, superjump and PwUp messages), the spree messages, the
  specialist's suicide (-5); points and streaks before the DeathMsg; the "killed" log line's tags; the One's
  death handled for any killer, before the suicide check, his streak cleared.
- 2 The One: Think draws on g_theOneMode (no "the_one" cvar); SelectRandomTheOne and TheOneIsDead move the
  players' teams (SetDefaultPlayerTeam, ChangePlayerTeam); SetPlayerTheOne sends the two PwUp messages.
- 3 CTSGun::Reset clears the WeaponInfo type/reserve caches to 0, so a kung-fu newcomer gets none; reTS's
  extra clip/fire mode/equip resend stays for its client, seeded at the first check.
- 4 TSHealth truncated with the original's float compare; no Health/Battery; the client's dead test reads
  TSHealth (as client.dll @0x10026860). 5 Killed sends TSActiveItems {index, 0}, no CurWeapon.
Tests: reTS copies tsx_score, tsx_one; newcomer test back in tsx_weapons; two ts_damage tests. Full tsx-ts3
suite on reTS 523/523 twice; ts30 set 138/138 twice each in deathmatch and teamplay.
Found, not changed: kill cash, headshot/knife/katana/coldcock notices, the spectacular slow-motion point,
the slowmatch powerup, the team kill kick/ban and the #TS_OwnWeapon kill in PlayerKilled; teammate kills
not logged (CHalfLifeTeamplay::DeathNotice); the One's PreThink regeneration, GetSpeedBySlots 330 and
CanDive* for the One; TSArmor rounds; CurWeapon in StartObserver/UCD/observer; Killed leaves pev->fov.

## 2026-10-08 — the client keeps its ammo HUD, the rest of PlayerKilled, The One, messages

Round 12 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations12.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations12.
- 1 Client: HUD_WeaponsPostThink hands the predicted gun's clip, fire mode and attachments to the ammo HUD
  and its clip (and the akimbo/single variants' parked clips) to the weapon bar, as client.dll's
  CTSGun::UpdateClientData @0x1000acd0/@0x100581c0; the melee bar is a float the KFuPower handler clamps to
  -100..100 and Think regenerates (15/s, 1/s below -0.001, scaled by the local slow, @0x1004ce10); the
  WeaponInfo handler stores what comes (clip into the clip, kung fu's bar too, grid cell for type >= 1); the
  carry count (knife, M61, seal knife) draws the clip. Server: WeaponInfo only on a type or reserve change
  (kung fu: type change only, bar truncated), no knife count on the reserve.
- 2 PlayerKilled: kill cash (pts*500+400 / 900), the objective-mode cash (rules mode > 1, 1000; round 11
  called it last man standing), the headshot/knife/katana/coldcock notices naming the killer (coldcock moved
  out of DeathNotice), the spectacular kill's slow-motion bubble, the slowmatch powerup, the team-kill kick
  or ban (m_flTeamKillTime/m_iTeamKills, 0x7c4/0x7c8, cleared in CTSGameRules::InitHUD), the own-weapon kill
  (item hOwner == victim) with its notice and " (victims_weapon)" tag.
- 3 PlayerKilled works out the weapon name (TSKillWeaponName), calls DeathNotice (DeathMsg + director
  only) and writes the log (TSLogKill), so team kills are logged. ChangePlayerTeam/ClientUserInfoChanged
  stamp GetPlayerModel's "" for a team without models (no team-name fallback); round 11's One-mode model
  column was mostly the servers' differing game.cfg (mp_teammodels "seal;agent" on TS 3.0).
- 4 The One: PreThink regeneration (0.16 x others per tick, 1/max(0.32 x others, 1) s, cap 150) with the
  count of others from Think (rules+0x5876, m_iTheOneOthers); GetSpeedBySlots 330; CanDive* always.
- 5 TSArmor truncated with the float compare; no CurWeapon in StartObserver, UCD's no-weapon block or
  observer.cpp; WStatus compares the owned byte only, caches start 0; gun UCD throttled to 0.1 s
  (m_flNextClientUpdate, gun+0x9e0, cleared by Deploy).
- 6 Killed clears pev->fov; the One's Think block runs before the round logic.
Tests: new ts_kills and ts_messages (reTS + ts30), tsx_one gains team-kill log, kick, regen, speed, dive.
Found, not changed: RemoveAllItems lacks the original's CurWeapon(0,0,0) and PlayerDeathThink lacks its
RemoveAllItems(1); the kung fu slot's WStatus to a newcomer; Observer_CheckProperties is not in the
original; the One block is skipped for modes > 1 in the original; GetSpeedBySlots truncates in the
original; ActItems from CTSGun::UpdateClientData is reTS's; client draws (bar for every caliber-0 weapon,
breathing on any weapon); InitHUD clears player+0x7cc, which reTS lacks.

## 2026-10-08 — round 13: the round-12 leftovers (death strip, kung fu slot, Think, speed, ActItems, client)

Round 13 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations13.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations13.
- 1 RemoveAllItems ends with CurWeapon 0 0 0 (@0xc8ef9); PlayerDeathThink strips a dead player still
  holding anything (HasWeapons -> RemoveAllItems(1), @0x7ec03), so death to spectating sends two.
- 2 Kung fu is never owned: CTSGun::Spawn does not mark a melee seed owned, BuyArmament gives no kung fu
  (the original's @0x83f10 gives none), so no WStatus for slot 0; the client weapon bar's Reset puts kung
  fu in its cell itself (client.dll @0x1004cd60), as against the original server.
- 3 Observer_CheckProperties and m_iObserverWeapon removed (not in the original; reTS never called it).
- 4 Think: the dynamic powerups, the One check and the LMS rounds run only for rules mode 0/1, in that
  order. Powerups gated as @0x672e9: rules+1 (m_iRandomPowerups, -1 Init, 0 when a map's own ts_powerup
  spawns first, -1 again after item_longjump, 1 at the first Think), nopowerup != 1; a slow motion one a
  quarter of the time unless slowmatch is 1; next 20 s / 1 s; cleared when more than 21 s off.
- 5 GetSpeedBySlots truncates to a whole number (@0x66c04).
- 6 ActItems moved from CTSGun::UpdateClientData to CBasePlayer::UpdateClientData (@0x82393): live
  player holding the gun, GetActiveItems (with the akimbo 0x40), cache m_iClientActiveItems (0x720)
  cleared by TSInit and ForceClientDllUpdate. CTSGun::m_iClientAttach removed.
- 7 Client: the melee bar for every weapon without a caliber (M61 included); the breathing is
  client.dll Think's state machine (below 50: breathe2.wav 0.7 on channel 502; at 50 it fades 0.005 a
  frame with SND_CHANGE_VOL), whatever is held.
- 8 m_flKickTime (0x7cc, InitHUD clears it, PreThink's dead delayed kick reads it) and m_iPlayerModel
  (0x758, GetPlayerModel's pick).
Tests: ts_messages (newcomer no WStatus, two CurWeapon 0 0 0, ActItems akimbo tag), tsx_player (pickup
speed truncated), ts_powerup_state (map powerups leave out random ones), reTS + ts30. The amd64 AMX Mod X
core's floatround_tozero rounds 239.63 to 240: SpeedBySlots helpers now floor.
Found, not changed: see amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations13-report.md.

## 2026-10-08 — round 14: the round-13 leftovers (RemoveAllItems, spawn, Think, SetFOV, client, ActItems)

Round 14 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations14.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations14.
- 3 RemoveAllItems (@0xc8cec): no func_tank release, no SetHasSuit; removeSuit clears every weapon bit,
  otherwise only a held suit bit stays (pev->weapons &= 0x80000000).
- 4 PlayerSpawn strips nothing (@0x790ac); the round-restart guard is gone (RestartRound already sends
  every player in play to spectate, which strips him).
- 5 CTSGun::Spawn (@0x7053c) seeds nothing: Reset, classname, Precache, glock model, id 16, m_iClip 1,
  m_iDefaultAmmo 1, type 0, FallInit. GiveTSWeapon (reTS's, uncalled) spawns an empty gun and gives the
  weapon through TakeWeapon.
- 6 Observer_CheckTarget removed (not in the original, never called).
- 7 UpdateClientData sends no SetFOV; the zoom reaches the client in cd->fov (HUD_PostRunCmd copies it to
  g_lastFOV, client.dll @0x100045e6 as in the SDK). SetFOV only from Killed and StartObserver.
- 8 Think: no per-frame slowmatch block; CBulletManager::m_iActive (+0x4000, rules+0x5864: recounted in
  Think, +1 per FireBullet, 0 in Reset) gates the bullet Think, which runs after the realbullet SrvSett
  (@0x67635); usecash's SrvSett reads dmcashbased (registered as "usecash").
- 9 InitHUD in the objective modes (m_iGameMode 2/3) clears m_iPlayerModel and calls SendObjectiveList
  (@0x69592). Not reachable on these maps.
- 10 Client: the melee bar as client.dll @0x1004d5f0 (raw hud_r/g/b; at 0.01 or below only the frame in
  0xc3,0x2d,0x2d; else fill (int)(bar*1.28)-2 wide in (r*128/255, w*g/255, w*b/255) at alpha 255-w, then
  the 128x19 frame at alpha 0x1e). The heartbeat is Think's state machine (@0x1004cf8b: slow < 1 starts
  heartbeat1.wav at 1.0 on channel 501, fading 0.01 a frame); the four beats on slow motion entry are gone.
- 11 StartObserver sends ActItems {idx, 0} itself, before its SetFOV (@0x897b4), so a teamplay joiner's
  team change (StartObserver alone) sends one: two ActItems 0 for a teamplay joiner, as TS 3.0.
Tests: ts_messages (no weapon bits after death, spawn while armed strips nothing, no SetFOV after a spawn,
joiner ActItems per StartObserver), ts_powerup_state (slowmatch slows nobody), reTS + ts30.
Found, not changed: the global ShouldCollide dereferences a NULL pentOther (a plugin trace with no entity
to skip crashed rets-r11); StartObserver strips with RemoveAllItems(false) where the original passes 1;
Spectator 1 1 is sent from TSEnterSpectate, not StartObserver; more in amxxbench
docs/fixes/rets-deviations14-report.md.

## 2026-10-08 — round 15: the ShouldCollide crash and the round-14 leftovers

Round 15 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations15.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations15.
- 1 The global ShouldCollide is the original's (@0x9b7b4): either edict may be NULL; the touched entity's
  ShouldCollide decides unless it has FL_KILLME, else 1. It crashed on a plugin trace with no skip entity.
  Of the other exported callbacks, AddToFullPack's m_EFlags read (halflife-updated) and DispatchSave/
  DispatchRestore's save-time read now check for NULL first, as the original does; the rest already matched.
- 2 StartObserver strips with RemoveAllItems(true) (@0x89983): a spectator has no weapon bits.
- 3 StartObserver ends with Spectator {idx, 1} (@0x899c2), not TSEnterSpectate: two for a teamplay joiner.
- 4 Think's SrvSett: realbullet and usecash compare (float)cache != value and cache the value chopped;
  ammocount is chopped and compared as an int (@0x675b3, @0x67650, @0x676d8).
- 5 CTSGun::Reset leaves the active item and weapon info NULL (@0x7061c).
- 6 Think runs CheckDeads when rules+0x5880 is set and below the time (@0x672ac); CheckDeads clears it.
- 7 Client: CHud::Think eases m_iFOV toward the target as client.dll 0x10049760/0x10049620 (default_fov held
  to 70..110, 80 under 0.001; step |gap|/2 x frametime x 50, at least 1); V_CalcRefdef keeps v_frametime
  on entry (0x10069b9e). Checked by build and disassembly only.
Tests: ts_callbacks (NULL-skip trace hits a player; fixed build only), ts_messages (joiner spectates
without weapon bits, Spectator right after each StartObserver's strip, SrvSett truncation), reTS + ts30.
Found, not changed: CTSWorldGun::ShouldCollide is the original's inverted (@0x91290 collides with everything
but guns and knives); more in amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations15-report.md.

## 2026-10-08 — round 16: CTSWorldGun::ShouldCollide and the round-15 leftovers

Round 16 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations16.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations16.
- 1 CTSWorldGun::ShouldCollide is the original's (@0x91290): collide with everything but "WorldGun" and
  "knife". NULL (no other) still collides; the original reads it unchecked. CBaseEntity's and CTSKnife's
  (return 1) already matched; no other class has one in the original.
- 2 ServerActivate skips edicts 0 to clientMax - 1 (@0x9e96e): the world is not activated, edict
  clientMax is.
- 3 ClientUserInfoChanged sends the name-change SayText whatever maxClients is (@0x9e750).
- 4 Sys_Error logs "Sys_Error: %s\n" at_logged (@0x9eebc).
- 5 ClientDisconnect formats the leave line whatever the name and neither resets the client's sound nor
  releases a func_tank (@0x9cd4c).
- 6 The four SrvSett go out once, from InitHUD (@0x691fe..0x69316). The 0.75 s timer (now
  m_flRosterResendTime) still carries the invented ResendTeamRoster. ce04557 recorded this resend as
  load-bearing for the original client's buy menu at join; that needs a real-client check.
- 7 Client: MsgFunc_SetFOV as client.dll 0x10049570 (ignored while cl_lw is on; 80 for 0; sensitivity
  newfov x 0.0125 x sensitivity x zoom_sensitivity_ratio); CHud::Think reads no screen info and takes no
  spectator FOV (0x10049760). Checked by build and disassembly only.
Tests: ts_callbacks (a flying gun's ShouldCollide pairs; the world not activated), ts_messages (a joiner
gets each SrvSett once), reTS + ts30.
Found, not changed: CTSWorldGun::Fall settles below GiveSlowMul() x 3 (@0x90df0), reTS below 3; more in
amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations16-report.md.

## 2026-10-09 — round 17: the invented join resends, Fall's settle speed, the client's sensitivity

Round 17 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations17.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations17.
Every resend removed here was added in July (ce04557, d99e07c, 6e7ce98, bdb229b, eb117a6, 6a25b0f) for a
real-client symptom whose cause was the joiner's InitHUD burst going out from inside ClientPutInServer,
before the client was active. 2999c75 (round 3) moved that send to the joiner's first PreThink as the
original does; join-stream dumps now show nothing but TSFade and one weapon anim going out before then,
on both games (amxxbench docs/fixes/srvsett-investigation-report.md).
- 1 The team roster resends are gone: ResendTeamRoster and its 0.75 s timer (m_flRosterResendTime), and
  CHalfLifeTeamplay::Think's 3 s MSG_ALL GameMode/TeamNames/TeamInfo. The original sends GameMode only from
  UpdateGameMode and TeamNames/TeamInfo only from Teamplay InitHUD, ChangePlayerTeam, RecountTeams and
  StartObserver.
- 2a The one-shot slow motion and award un-latch (m_flSpecResyncTime) is gone.
- 2b UpdateClientData's ResetHUD block no longer clears the TSHealth/TSArmor/TSCash caches (0x81d57 clears
  none). They are cleared where the original clears them: TSInit health and cash (@0x82ac9, @0x82b02),
  Spawn and Precache armor (@0x7f9a0, @0xca997), Killed cash (@0x7eead), ForceClientDllUpdate all three.
- 2c No WeaponList (only LinkUserMessages uses gmsgWeaponList).
- 2d The room type goes out from CEnvSound::Think when an env_sound takes the player over (@0xd0003), not
  from UpdateClientData on a change (halflife-updated bc3add9), so a join or spawn sends none.
- 3 CTSWorldGun::Fall settles below GiveSlowMul() x 3.0 (@0x90de9).
- 4 Client: CHud::Think scales with sensitivity->value (0x10049865), not IN_GetMouseSensitivity.
Tests: ts_messages (team roster only in the InitHUD frame; no HUD re-sends, WeaponList or room type for a
waiting joiner; a spawn sends health, armor and cash once), ts_dropped (a gun at a quarter rate does not
settle at 1.5 u/s), reTS + ts30. Real-client checks listed in amxxbench docs/things-to-test.md.
Found, not changed: TS 3.0 sends two svc_weaponanim (1, 0) in each joiner StartObserver, reTS none; Train
goes after TSArmor in the original's UpdateClientData; the respawn countdown's first number and frame and
the "Press Fire To Play!" line differ; Fall goes on after settling in the original. More in amxxbench
docs/fixes/rets-deviations17-report.md.

## 2026-10-09 — round 18: StartObserver's holster, UpdateClientData, the countdown, TSFade, Fall

Round 18 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations18.md), the round-17 leftovers. One patch per item in
~/stignored/rets-deviations18.
- 1 StartObserver (@0x8970f-0x89755): with the gun in hand Reset and HolsterWeapon, then Holster(0)
  (HolsterWeapon again). HolsterWeapon's kung fu draw goes out with skiplocal 0 (@0x75858), now forced
  with m_ForceSendAnimations, so a joiner gets two svc_weaponanim in his InitHUD frame as on TS 3.0, and
  a predicting client gets the draw on every switch.
- 2 UpdateClientData as the original's (@0x81d00-0x82593): Train after TSArmor; no flashlight upkeep,
  game title, InitStatusBar, status bar, SendAmmoUpdate, item loop or m_bRestored clear; only the
  active item's update when it is the gun (id 16), then the active item and FOV caches.
- 3 PreThink runs MakeVectors, ItemPreFrame, WaterMove, UpdateClientData, CheckTimeBasedDamage and
  CheckSuitUpdate right after the game-over return (@0x80940-0x8096c), before the TS upkeep and the
  spectate block, so the joiner's first countdown line goes out in his InitHUD frame; the spectate
  block's own UpdateClientData call (cont.98) is gone. The countdown truncates (@0x80edc chop), shows
  "Press Fire To Play!" when that gives 0 and paints nothing after the gate (round 7f/7g's rounding and
  post-gate prompt undone; 7g's missing prompt came from the rounding).
- 4 TSFade divides by GiveSlowMul and truncates (@0xdccbf, @0xdccfb), no +0.5. The spawn fade's 4095/4096
  depends only on the spawn time's float bits; reTS computes it as the original for every float time
  (~/stignored/rets-deviations18/tools/fadecheck.c).
- 5 CTSWorldGun::Fall goes on after OnGround to the lifetime check, trace and upkeep (@0x90e4e).
- 6 Client: hud.cpp's unused IN_GetMouseSensitivity declaration removed.
Tests: ts_messages (two weapon anims at the joiner's StartObserver; Train after TSArmor; the countdown;
TSFade at slow 0.6), ts_dropped (the settling think runs the slow-motion upkeep), reTS + ts30.
Found, not changed: StartObserver drops the flag before the holster (the original after); WeaponIdle and
CCombatIdle send with skiplocal 0 in the original; the LMS window line rounds and its expiry runs outside
the spectate block; Fall's trace skips players in the original; impulse 100's flashlight has no original;
PwUp's byte is clamped at 0 in the original. More in amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations18-report.md.

## 2026-10-09 — round 19: the round-18 leftovers

Round 19 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations19.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations19.
- 1 StartObserver drops the flag after the holster (DropFlag @0x8975f follows @0x89755).
- 2 CTSGun::WeaponIdle (@0x75646) and CCombatIdle (@0x75e94) send their idle anims with skiplocal 0
  (m_ForceSendAnimations), so a predicting client gets them as from TS 3.0.
- 3 PreThink in the original's order: after CheckSuitUpdate the slow-motion ease and framerate, the timer
  countdowns, the landing check and CTSStunt::Play, UpdateTimers, the powerup state and slow-motion flow,
  the root timer's expiry, the melee bar regen (IsAlive only, @0x80d66), the run-through window's expiry,
  then the spectate block, spectators included; CheckForBreakables first after the block (@0x810ee). The
  stock view-entity and node-graph blocks are gone.
- 4 The re-entry window's line truncates (@0x81063) and its expiry runs inside the spectate block
  (@0x80fb3): 6 down to 0, and a player in play is no longer told to wait for the next round.
- 5 CTSWorldGun::Fall's trace skips players and has no takedamage test (@0x90f2b-0x90f3d).
- 6 impulse 100 removed (the original's ImpulseCommands has 99, 201, 204 only); no client dependency.
- 7 PwUp's seconds byte clamped at 0 (@0x82295).
- 8 InitStatusBar and UpdateStatusBar removed.
Tests: ts_messages (gun and bare-hands idle anims, PwUp clamp), ts_dropped (falling gun spares a player),
ts_observer (spectator's slow motion eases, LMS window), ts_cheats (impulse 100), reTS + ts30.
Found, not changed: TSInit does not clear the re-entry window (@0x82d5b); PreThink's spread decay, health
regen position, framerate, +0xb88 stamp, iuser4 0x400000 bit, timer floors and the gravity timer; the
landing check belongs to PostThink; impulse 204 missing and cheat impulses 76/101/203 extra; flashlight
and status-bar leftovers; m_flPowerupTime float vs int; a reTS team-change test failure when the server
starts in deathmatch. Details in amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations19-report.md.

## 2026-10-09 — round 20: a test fix, then the round-19 leftovers

Round 20 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations20.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations20.
- 1 ts_observer "team change keeps the jump clock" failed on reTS started in deathmatch because the map
  change execs game.cfg (InstallGameRules @0xb6050, both games) and that run's game.cfg says mp_teamplay 0;
  TS 3.0 fails the same with such a game.cfg. The test (reTS and ts30 copies) now sets game.cfg aside
  without its mp_teamplay line for the switch, as ts_kills does. No game change.
- 2 TSInit clears the re-entry window (+0x7bc, @0x82d5b).
- 3 PreThink as the original: framerate = GiveSlowMul() every frame (@0x80999); the +0xb88 ground stamp
  for every player (@0x809ab, no longer in CTSStunt::Play); the run-through, root and gravity timers
  floored at 0.001 (@0x809f4-0x80a90); iuser4 0x400000 (TSSTUNT_NOVIEWOFS) for a zero view_ofs
  (@0x80b4a); the health regen before the spectate block (@0x80bc1); the root timer expires only with
  STOP set (@0x80cf6); the gravity timer expires to gravity 1.0 (@0x80d24); the spread decays in the
  IsAlive block with the timers' delta x 0.1 (@0x80d77). m_bSlowMoveApplied is now unused (kept).
- 4 The super-jump landing check is in PostThink's landing block (@0x818ec-0x81a31).
- 5 Impulse 204 (ForceClientDllUpdate) without cheats (@0xcb9b0); cheat impulses 76, 101, 203 removed
  (table @0xcba3c). Impulse 101 with sv_cheats 1 ended a 267b362 server with a Host_Error (w_battery.mdl
  precache); gone with it.
- 6 FlashlightIsOn/TurnOn/TurnOff and FAllowFlashlight removed (gamerules vtables one slot shorter, as the
  original's); the save fields and status-bar members stay (moving offsets, see the report).
- 7 m_flPowerupTime is m_iPowerupTime, an int (@0x82259); rets_api v5 (Get/SetPowerupTime int), both
  header copies; reTSX on tsx-ts3 updated.
Tests: ts_observer (re-entry window ends with the life, zero view offset bit, the jump clock fix),
ts_cheats (impulse 204, cheat impulses not in the table), ts_powerup_state (animation rate), reTS + ts30.
Found, not changed: the gate sentinel is -1.0 in the original, -4.0 in reTS (three sites); the landing's
roll stamp and sound pitch; ItemPostFrame runs impulses during the spawn's attack delay in the original;
PreThink's fuser1 0 -> 1 guard; mp_flashlight cvar and flashlight1.wav precache; CMultiplayBusters and
sv_busters; TSInit's unnamed zeroings. Details in amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations20-report.md.

## 2026-10-09 — round 21: three game.cfg tests, then the round-20 leftovers

Round 21 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations21.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations21.
- 1 ts_gamerules (team spot, repeated team name) and ts_rounds (teamplay wipe) failed on a server whose
  game.cfg says mp_teamplay 0 (both games): they now set game.cfg aside without that line for their map
  change. Tests only.
- 2 The wait-for-next-round mark is -1.0 at all three writers (@0x660dc, @0x80fe9, @0x8fa06); 55f85a0 had
  made the PreThink one -4.0 from a misread decompile.
- 3 Super-jump landing: m_flRollNextTime = time + 0.3 before GoRoll (@0x81940), so the duck landing rolls;
  the plant's sound at pitch 95 + RANDOM_LONG(0, 31) (@0x81997).
- 4 CBasePlayer::ItemPostFrame's attack-delay hold as @0xcc4ff: only a gun with a weapon in hand is held,
  and +alt2 on a reloading gun with a bash gets through. Impulses and bare hands run during the delay.
- 5 No fuser1 0 -> 1.0 step in PreThink (none before @0x80974); the client floors the predicted slow
  factor at 0.01 (client.dll 0x10055aa0) instead of reading 0 as 1.0.
- 6 mp_flashlight and the items/flashlight1.wav precache removed.
- 7 CMultiplayBusters, sv_busters and the busting helpers removed (InstallGameRules @0xb6050).
- 8 TSInit zeroes 0x740, 0x77c-0x784, the 33 dwords at 0x184 (new members m_iTSInit*, last in
  CBasePlayer so nothing moves; nothing else in ts_i386.so touches them) and the chat clock (0x7c0 =
  m_flNextChatTime, read by Host_Say @0x9d09c).
Tests (reTS + ts30): ts_observer (gate -1.0), ts_powerup_state (landing pitch, duck roll, slow factor
from 0), ts_cheats (impulse in the spawn delay), ts_damage (bash cuts a reload), ts_gamerules (no
flashlight/busters, spawn zeroing). Found, not changed: ItemPostFrame's second m_pTank check and its
missing random_seed reroll (@0xcc575); TSInit also zeroes 0x750 (m_flNextPTakeDamTime) and 0x788;
Spawn's stock m_flNextChatTime = time; sv_allowbunnyhopping and sv_pushable_fixed_tick_fudge are
not in the original. Details in amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations21-report.md.

## 2026-10-09 — round 22: a test guard, then the round-21 leftovers

Round 22 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations22.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations22.
- 1 ts_gamerules' spawn zeroing test wrote past the end of the player on reTS before 58c5ca9 and ended
  both servers in round 21. It now reads the player's block size (new amxxbench native
  bench_private_size, malloc_usable_size) and writes nothing unless the fields fit; on 8dd2877 it
  refuses (3864 bytes, 4016 needed). Tests only.
- 2 CBasePlayer::ItemPostFrame: no second m_pTank check (halflife-updated #3345), and random_seed =
  RANDOM_LONG(0, 32000) after the item's frame (@0xcc575). Only the guns' fire functions read it
  (@0x72303-0x73201), always after CmdStart's write; client.dll has no reroll.
- 3 TSInit zeroes m_flNextPTakeDamTime (0x750, @0x82ca8) and 0x788 (@0x82d65, new m_iTSInit788, last
  in CBasePlayer: amd64 size unchanged at 4016 (tail padding), i386 3380 -> 3384).
- 4 Spawn no longer sets m_flNextChatTime = time (stock SDK line; the original leaves 0x7c0 to TSInit).
- 5 sv_allowbunnyhopping (halflife-updated a1cf2d3) and sv_pushable_fixed_tick_fudge (HL25 backport
  4f0d502) removed with the "bj" physinfo key; PM_PreventMegaBunnyJumping always runs (@0xf00d4).
  CPushable::Move is the original's (@0xb1c50): pre-HL25 Move plus TS's 0.3 scaling of the toucher's
  velocity while he holds +use. coverage.py's server cvar scan let defaults up to 40 chars through
  (mp_teamlist's "hitman;gordon" was dropped at 12); REPORT.md regenerated: 44 matched, 0 extra.
- 6 Client: HUD_WeaponsPostThink's gate is client.dll's (0x10003d46): deadflag != 5, !CL_IsDead
  (0x10026860) and m_flNextAttack <= 0. The spectator and viewmodel/zoom tests are gone; round 7l had
  narrowed the gate for a hang that was TS_EvWeaponAnim calling itself (fixed in 7l-b, fea3cb3).
Tests (reTS + ts30): ts_gamerules (spawn zeroing extended to 0x750/0x788 and chat clock 0, no
bunnyhop/pushable cvars or bj key, pushable push/pull), ts_damage (seed rerolled). Details in amxxbench
docs/fixes/rets-deviations22-report.md.

## 2026-10-09 — round 23: the TS 3.0 start-up crash, then the round-22 leftovers

Round 23 (amxxbench docs/fixes/rets-deviations23.md). One patch per item in ~/stignored/rets-deviations23.
- 1 The TS 3.0 crash of round 22 (core pid 287512): the world edict was free with no private data and
  classname worldspawn, serial 1 (ED_ParseEdict's no-init path: the engine's GetEntityInit found no
  "worldspawn" in metamod's or ts_i686.so's handle, though both were in its extension table at the
  crash). CWorld::Spawn/Precache never ran (27 sound precaches, no ClientPrecache, no rules, no
  server.cfg from the rules), so the first puppet's ClientConnect called a NULL g_pGameRules. Not the
  bench's game.cfg handling, not a map change, not the LMS patch; one map load in ~4,900 on that copy.
  ReHLDS looks entities up the same way, so reTS has the window: ClientConnect now refuses a client when
  g_pGameRules is NULL (before the ts_playeramount relays count him). The bench runs no tests on a map
  whose world did not spawn (amxxbench 804c1c6).
- 2 amxxbench run.sh passes the filter in AMXXBENCH (f4e04bf); bench only.
- 3 sv_load_all_maps / sv_stop_loading_all_maps removed (halflife-updated 19d94e4, Sam V, for node
  graph generation; not in ts_i386.so), with their StartFrame hook and includes. coverage.py lists
  the server's pfnAddServerCommand registrations (original: the `call *0x230` sites in GameDLLInit);
  REPORT.md: 7 matched, 0 extra.
- 4 menuselect is the original's: CHalfLifeMultiplay::ClientCommand (@0xbeee8) and
  CHalfLifeTeamplay::ClientCommand (@0xd43c8) strcmp it (string @0xfd78f). coverage.py only read
  ClientCommand; it now reads the game rules' too. Server client commands: 21 matched, 0 extra. No code
  change.
Tests (reTS + ts30): ts_gamerules no_load_all_maps_commands; ts_powerup_state's duck roll test now
faces open ground (a spawn spot facing a wall failed it once in 42 runs). Details in amxxbench
docs/fixes/rets-deviations23-report.md.

## 2026-10-10 — grenade powerup refused; a phantom weapon on the bar after the last grenade

amxxbench docs/fixes/grenade-powerup.md. Scratch in ~/stignored/grenade-powerup.
- Grenade powerup not picking up: TS 3.0 refuses it the same way. PlayerAddPowerUp @0x87d4e calls
  PickUpWeapon(M61, 0, 0, select, no owner); PickUpWeapon @0x8314c refuses when player+0x548 (free
  slots) minus the M61's 7 is below 0; TakeWeapon @0x70a04 refuses a third M61 (cap 2); WaitTouch
  @0x88614 leaves a refused powerup where it is. Steven's Mossberg, Raging Bull, katana and Skorpion
  use 80 of 81 slots. Puppets agree on both games (ts_pickups, 8 tests). No game change.
- Phantom M4 on the weapon bar after throwing the last M61: the server is right (both games send
  TSSpace, WStatus 24 0 0 and WeaponInfo for the next weapon, nothing for the M4). The reTS client
  marked every wielded type owned in HUD_WeaponsPostThink (8922f0c7, for the coldcock event gate) and
  never cleared it, so its predicted DropWeapon -> GetBetterWeapon picked a weapon wielded earlier in
  the session (M4 is 4th in priority) and TSHud_GunUpdate gave it a bar cell the server never clears.
  client.dll never sets an item owned (Reset @0x10008470 clears, HUD_WeaponsPostThink fills the item
  without +0), so its DropWeapon @0x100085d0 is a no-op. Fixed: no owned flag on the client; the
  coldcock event plays on any active item on the client (client.dll @0x10008dc8 has no gate), owned
  gate kept on the server (@0x81f80). Server libraries byte-identical to 52113a0.

## 2026-10-10 — fire-to-play: the press sends "respawn", and its clock restarts on a new map

amxxbench docs/fixes/join-spawn-click.md (report join-spawn-click-report.md). Scratch in ~/stignored/join-spawn.
- TS 3.0's fire-to-play is client-side: TS replaced CHudSpectator::HandleButtonsDown (client.dll
  0x10023450, 67 bytes) with a 0.2 s throttle on +0xc94 and, for IN_ATTACK, ClientCmd("respawn"). The
  +attack/+attack2/+jump/+duck/move down handlers call it (not +use); +0xc94 is zeroed by Init
  (0x10022c70), VidInit (0x10022fe0) and the director reset (0x10023380). No spectate or menu test. The
  server (both games) takes only the command: Observer_HandleButtons (@0x89d34) reads jump, forward and
  back, never attack. While the buy menu is up with the cursor shown, IN_MouseEvent (0x100273d0) gives a
  click to the menu only (FUN_10038360: outside an entry = key 1, "use config", which closes it), so the
  first click on joining closes the menu and later clicks send "respawn".
- reTS (55f85a0, July 3) polled in_attack.state once a frame in CHudSpectate::Draw behind a
  function-static 0.2 s clock and an IsUp() test. The static was never reset, so after a map change or
  a reconnect in the same game process (client time starts again near 0) no "respawn" went out until the
  new clock passed the previous map's last fire time. The July client.so has the same code.
- Now as the original: HandleButtonsDown's TS body (throttle on m_flNextObserverInput, which Init,
  VidInit and InitHUDData already zero; IN_ATTACK sends "respawn"), +use no longer calls it,
  TS_SpectateFireCheck gone. The stock body (duck toggling the spectator menu and its cursor, use for
  the inset, HLTV target and mode keys) is gone with it, as in client.dll. Server libraries
  byte-identical to 31eabf7.
- Not done: client.dll's IN_*Down handlers for +attack, +attack2, +jump and the moves call KeyDown only
  when HUD_Key_Event saw a key bound to one of them this frame (0x100df5cc, set at 0x10025c9c, cleared
  by HUD_Frame), so those commands from a script or alias do nothing there. reTS has no such gate.
Test (reTS + ts30): ts_observer held_fire_does_not_spawn_a_joiner, passing on both games in both modes.

## 2026-10-10 — the death notice: HUD sprites reloaded on every map, weapon named in text

amxxbench docs/fixes/grenade-death-icon.md (report grenade-death-icon-report.md). Scratch in
~/stignored/grenade-death-icon.
- Steven saw a crouching figure where a grenade death's notice should show the skull. The server is not
  involved: on both games a grenade death sends DeathMsg (killer, victim, "M61 Grenade") and no TSState
  (puppets, other, ducked and self). It was the reTS client's death notice drawing the skull through a
  stale sprite handle.
- client.dll CHud::VidInit (@0x100206e1) sets m_iRes to 320 below 640 wide and 640 otherwise, on every
  call. reTS kept HL25's 1280/2560 pick (halflife-updated 246c1d5) plus a fallback to 640 that ran only
  on the first load (e5ca177, 2026-06-21). From the second VidInit on (every map) m_iRes was 1280 again,
  matched nothing in TS's hud.txt, and no hud.txt sprite was reloaded; the engine handed their handles
  to sprites loaded later. Read live from Steven's hl_linux at 1920x1080: m_iRes 1280, d_skull handle 10
  (640hud1 at startup), m_TSStatus crouched.spr handle 10. Now 320/640 on every call as client.dll.
- client.dll's death notice (Draw @0x1001b020, DeathMsg @0x1001b360) never looks a sprite up (iId -1):
  it keeps the weapon name (item +0x9c) and writes it in orange (1, 0.5, 0.2) between the names; the
  name is cleared for a suicide, a team kill and a non-player kill, which draw the skull, white (team
  kill green). Rows at y 20, 40, 60, 80, text and sprite on the same line. reTS drew the stock HL sprite
  lookup (d_<weapon>, so always the skull for TS's weapon names) in orange at y 66 + gap. Now as client.dll.
- Not done: GetClientColor (@0x1001af40) returns white for the local player, team 1-4 colours and no
  colour otherwise; reTS's stock one (yellow for team 0, grey default) is shared with say text, the
  status bar and the spectator HUD. ammo.cpp's weapon sprite list still picks 1280/2560 (HL25).
  TS 3.0 sends a red TSFade (1228 614 0 150 10 10 75) to the victim at death and reTS sends none.
Server libraries byte-identical to edffa35's.

## 2026-10-10 — buy menu clicks wait for VGUI windows, as client.dll's IN_MouseEvent

Steven (753f738 client, native): after the join click the cursor stayed and the mouse was not captured.
client.dll IN_MouseEvent (0x100273d0): cursor hidden -> key events; cursor shown -> the buy menu's mouse
(0x10038360) only when no VGUI window is up (viewport +0xa9c current menu, +0xaa0 and +0xad0 visible,
squelch, +0xad4 command menu), else nothing (VGUI has it). reTS (258a447, June) gave the buy menu every
click first. A join opens the MOTD (MsgFunc_MOTD -> ShowVGUIMenu 5 on both clients, 0x10064f60) with
the buy menu, so a click closed the buy menu under the MOTD and the MOTD kept g_iVisibleMouse set: cursor
shown, IN_MouseMove never re-grabbing. Now as client.dll (TeamFortressViewport::IsVGUIMenuUp,
TS_VGUIMenuUp). On GoldSrc Linux the grab is the client's SDL relative mode, re-enabled in IN_MouseMove
once g_iVisibleMouse is false; hw.so's EngineSurfaceWrap::setCursor (0x1ab660) only shows/hides the OS
cursor (m_rawinput 0). Not seen live: Steven did not join while ~/stignored/join-spawn/peek2.py watched.

## 2026-10-10 — an empty config still closes the buy menu, as client.dll

Steven (14a17a2 client): clicks after the MOTD closed reached the client (IN_MouseEvent, buy menu up,
no VGUI window) but the menu never closed. client.dll's key 1 at the config level (0x10038840 case 0)
calls apply (0x10039400) and closes the menu (0x10036720) when it returns true. Apply with nothing bought
shows "#Buy_ConfigEmpty" (red 195 45 45, hold 20) and goes on: it returns false only over the budget
("#Buy_NoCash") or the slot cap. reTS's Apply returned at once when m_spent <= 0 (258a447), so an empty
config could not be closed by any click. A config is empty whenever the menu opens with no applied
config to reload (only the first open on a map randomizes one). Now as client.dll.

## 2026-10-10 — client cvars audited against client.dll; cl_realhud; the slot handler

Every pfnRegisterVariable in client.dll (107: name, default, flags, kept pointer) and every read of it
was listed and the reads decompiled (tools in ~/stignored/client-cvars: regs.py, reads.py, table.py;
table in reference/API_SURFACE.md section 3). Fixed, each against the disassembly:
- cl_realhud: not 0 makes the status draw (0x1004a3e0, with the kung-fu/super-jump figures), the
  weapon panel (0x1004d7e0; kung fu's 0x1004d700 is not gated) and the crosshair draw (0x1004e9f0:
  ring, dive arc, laser range) return at once. The laser dot (0x1004e6f0) stays.
- nohud: no global gate in client.dll's Redraw; it hides the death notices (0x1001b020), the status
  draw's parts (0x10049f06: timer, TSMessage, flags, status, powerup label, objectives) and the weapon
  bar Draw after the laser dot (0x1004d3f9: buy menu, bar, weapon box, crosshair). Flags 0.
- cl_attackswitch (0x10025f40/0x10026110): swaps +attack2 and +alt2 unless kung fu or fire type
  grenade/knife/katana/flag. r_paintball (0x10001000): {splat0..17} decals.
- cl_bob: client.dll's bob is its own (0x10066e70 + 0x10066de0), not the Quake bob; ported, default
  "4.0". It replaced reTS's approximate sway (7cce5a7, halved later) and the tuned "aim up with
  speed" pitch, which the bob's amplitude gives (0x100674a0). cl_bobcycle/cl_bobup are never read.
- cl_buykevlar: ResetConfig (0x10038800) seeds kevlar; client.dll never writes the cvar.
- cl_drawnames gates the overview names (0x1002318f, the stock spec_drawnames test); cont94's note
  that it was a different consumer was wrong.
- Flags/defaults: hud_deathnotice_time, zoom_sensitivity_ratio, default_fov, nohud, cl_slowfade 0;
  cl_camtype/cam_back/cam_right/cam_up/cl_drawnames ARCHIVE; sensitivity ARCHIVE only; cam_idealdist
  "100".
- Slot keys: CHudTSWeaponBar::SelectSlot ports 0x1004f220 after 1796729's menu test: buy menu at its
  level (the HUD_Key_Event digit path removed), bomb wires cutwire_<n>, slot 10 weapon_0, the 17x11
  grid by weapon_info +0x85 row / +0x84 column (rows read from every Write_<weapon>), hud_fastswitch
  0 and 1.
- Server: UpdateClientData sends pev->fov (0xa0294), not m_iFOV.
Not done: gl_fog* (ts_fog lump parser + fog pass), cl_wavedetail (no client bullet simulation), cl_fx's
particle config. default_fov: both servers send fov 0 unzoomed (puppets) and the native reTS client
applies it live (Steven's hl_linux: default_fov 90 -> HUD FOV 90, engine FOV 90); the Windows report
needs a real-client check.

## 2026-10-10 — client gaps: the cvar round's leftovers, the cl_dll markers, cached handles
- Fixed every leftover of the client cvar round: gl_fog*/ts_fog and the ts_particle/ts_emitter
  entities (0x1003a5d0, 0x10056c20; map rain and snow), cl_fx's two particle levels (0x10057d50),
  the client bullet simulation and cl_wavedetail (0x10035010), the fire core (0x100450c0: seeded
  pellets, PM_STUDIO_BOX, pierce, whizz, particle pushes) and gun smoke (0x10047130), the credits
  box and "%ix" readout, the view model's FOV offset and punch-follow (0x100674a0), weapon_N for the
  held weapon, the bound-key gate on nine + commands (0x10025a80), the usepowerup held gate, decal
  ranges, m_side/+strafe/+mlook removed, scr_ofs* no longer read.
- Kept: slow-motion tint (0,60,160) (client.dll has (0,100,125), b8080fb's playtest tune holds);
  Steven's centred ammo numbers; the screen-space scope; the 64-bit string pool; togglebrowser no-op.
- HUD: number draw 0x1004c290, status panel 0x1004a3e0 (GameMode byte raw), weapon box 0x1004d7e0,
  weapon bar 0x1004e030, round timer 0x1004bb20, TSMessage queue 0x1004b520, crosshair 0x1004e9f0,
  laser/flashlight passes 0x1003de00/0x1003bad0, camera 0x10067fb0.., HUD_AddEntity tag culling.
- The client reads the powerup bits from clientdata vuser1.y, as client.dll; TS 3.0's server sends
  (float)m_iPowerups there (0xa0475), reTS's server sends m_flMeleeBar (server side to fix).
- Open questions for the server/shared side: observer modes (TS 1,2,3,5 with 5 in-eye; pm_shared.h
  OBS_IN_EYE 4); the akimbo bparam1 side is inverted vs client.dll (client.dll: nonzero = right gun).

## 2026-10-10 — server gaps: the cvars, the dlls/pm_shared markers, client data, observer modes

Every cvar ts_i386.so registers was listed from GameDLLInit (name, default, flags, order) with every
read (tools in ~/stignored/gaps-server: sregs.py, allreads.txt, retsreads.py; the table is in
amxxbench docs/fixes/gaps-server-report.md). The TS cvar_t live in game.cpp in .data order and
ts_cvars.cpp is gone. initial_cash, cashforwin, cashforlose and respawnnumber are defined but never
registered: ClientPutInServer and TeamWin sscanf their default strings (1200, 10000, 1200), the team
pools and SetPlayerRespawnTime read the value field (0). dmgreport stays registered (user approved).
StartFrame copies g_teamplay into gpGlobals->teamplay (0x9eadc); DecideGamePlay reads mp_teamplay
(reTS looked up "teamplay", which does not exist).
- Host_Say (0x9d17f), the multiplay ClientUserInfoChanged (0x7b244, HLDM model names refused),
  TeamWin (0x68a08), RoundTimeLeft (0x69024), the objectives, TSExplosion, the death drops (ammo
  pack without armor, M61s as grenade powerups outside the round modes), the flag toss, the dropped
  gun bounce, ts_trigger (0x60ad8), ts_playeramount, CBaseMonster's stub KeyValue and ts_model's base
  as the original. Bullets make no server sprites.
- UpdateClientData (0xa0294): vuser1.y = (float)m_iPowerups (the melee bar goes by its own message),
  iuser4 always, kung fu sends only the combo counters, no in-eye swap, no fuser2/fuser3.
- pm_shared.h: OBS_IN_EYE is 5, TS's number (Observer_SetMode 0x89e44 takes 1, 2, 3, 5); the map
  modes are 6 and 7, never sent. The akimbo events send item+0x24 (1 = left barrel) as bparam1
  (0x731e2), the linked shot too. fparam2 stays the view kick for reTS's client recoil; the original
  sends the spread.
- Kept: m_fGameHUDInitialized before InitHUD (recursion), GetBetterWeapon at spawn (5244abf), the
  dead body's angles held while it lingers (TS 3.0's server lets them follow the view; a puppet
  probe turned it 10 -> 120; the original client does not send the turn).
- Found, not changed: the death animation, DEAD_DYING about 1.5 s on TS 3.0 and 1.0 s on reTS after
  a generic-damage death.
- Bench: fakemeta's EngFunc_GetInfoKeyBuffer and create_kvd/set_kvd handles crash an amd64 server
  (pointers truncated to cells); use get_user_info and engine's DispatchKeyValue.

## 2026-10-10 — client gaps round 2: recoil, muzzle debris, decals, spectator view, buy menu text

- Recoil from the prediction (client.dll 0x10008230, called by its StandardFire/ShotgunFire/
  AkimboFire): pitch 0.85 x kick, the type's yaw scale, x0.775 silenced, x2/3 double fire rate, only
  on runfuncs, a 0.1 s 35 Hz shake for kicks within 0.15 s. The fire events carry the spread in
  fparam1 and fparam2 as ts_i386.so (0x728cd, 0x72405, 0x7321e); the fire core spreads up by fparam2.
  Test ts_fire_event (both copies).
- Shotgun muzzle debris (0x10046bd0 forced from the fire events), and the spawner's view/sight and
  throttle gates for its unforced impact callers. Bullet decals only on SOLID_BSP physents.
- Spectator: TS's PM_SpectatorMove (0xeef3c / client 0x1002c790) with GetChaseOrigin (90 back from
  35 up) moves the spectator; the client copy hands the view origin/angles and smoothing bits;
  V_CalcSpectatorRefdef is 0x10068f70 (client.dll's chase-position call there is dead, overwritten
  at its end). Test ts_spectator_view. The Spectator table is cleared with the scoreboard data only.
- Buy menu: labels and notices from titles.txt tokens as client.dll (entry draw localises), rows keyed
  '1'..'9','A', save/load/remove Go Back to the config column, Remove Item whole and compacted.
- default_fov on Windows: no platform path in reTS touches it; checks for a Windows client listed in
  amxxbench docs/fixes/gaps2-client-report.md and things-to-test 131.
- Found, not changed: pump fire.sc bparam1 (TS sends pump-mode, reTS clip==0), server VKickback's
  six-argument form, 0x10044bf0's impact classification, tsbuylist.tsa persistence.

## 2026-10-10 — server gaps round 2: the death, the SLICE markers, ground pickups, the briefcase

The dying state (TS 3.0 ~1.5 s, reTS ~1.0 s after a generic hit): TakeDamage turns the bullet dance on
for a hit not in the legs, under 80 speed, of 80 or less (@0x7fb11), so Killed's Animate case 7 plays
normal_die* (1.5 s) instead of die_spin (1.0 s); reTS never called Enable/DisableBulletDance. BulletDance's
gate was inverted (it re-poses while the sequence is NOT finished, @0x5d386). PlayerDeathThink has no
4 s cap and no body-queue copy.
- Killed (@0x7ed5c) rebuilt in the original's order: the TSMBlur rolls, deathcam, ResetArmament,
  SetView, EnableControl, respawns++, iuser2 and the observer target = a player inflictor, respawn gate,
  award 1/11, GoSlow(0.33) on a head shot (rules+0x18 is cleared by Init and never set), iuser4 = 2,
  Holster, the drops, then PlayerKilled; the damage-force push (max 500) and the 180/half-gravity throw
  for a fast or >50 non-dancing death; no SOLID_NOT and no DeathSound (it has no caller).
- TakeDamage: returns on 0 damage; the red TSFade (150,10,10) 75, 0.3/0.15 for a hit of 1 or more
  (@0x7fff8) replaces the SDK's punchangle.x = -2.
- The spectate flag m_fInSpectateWait is gone: PreThink's block tests iuser1 (@0x80e73) and returns,
  PlayerSpawn always equips (@0x790ac), Spawn has no spectate tail; a plugin's Spawn puts a spectator in play.
- SlowMotionFlow/DeactivateSlowMotionFlow/GlobalSlowMotion2 slow and restore grenades, knives and
  dropped guns (@0x86ea4, @0x86b55, @0x69720).
- AddItem bit 0x20 is the stealth shoes (objective modes, iuser4 0x200), not an M61.
- CTSGroundAmmo rebuilt (@0xa27e4..0xa2f40): one-shot pickup with the respawn schedule, not a station;
  PutOnWall for both ground pickups as the original (world or undamageable drawn walls, normal-facing);
  their drop sound on CHAN_STATIC; wduration and tsweaponid default 0.
- CTSBriefcase (@0x7d88c, @0x7db9c): trigger/fly spawn, the captured_briefcase log line (userid twice, as
  the original), "10" in the capture message, the solo branch resets team scores, the taunt to every
  player, the team scores always sent.
- Found, not changed: CTSGun's burst/double-fire/idle timing (PrimaryAttack @0x71a20 only arms a burst,
  WeaponIdle fires it; StandardFire does not decrement and idles 2.0 s); PrecacheAllTSWeapons precaches
  assets the original server never does, which the reTS client still relies on.

## 2026-10-10: game description tagged [reTS] (user-approved improvement)
- GetGameDescription's four strings (@0x10d004..) end in " [reTS]": "The Specialists (DM) [reTS]", (Teamplay),
  (The One), (LMS). Steven's choice (option D of four), so server browsers mark a reTS server; the name still
  starts with the original string. Clients and the master servers go by the gamedir, so the swap is unaffected.
  tsx_one.test.sma's reTS copy expects the tagged strings; the ts30 copy keeps the original ones.

## 2026-10-10: Ghidra varargs and engine-table types for client.dll/mp.dll, and the ports it exposed
- scripts/ghidra/ApplyWinTypes.java (run by `dc.sh setup client|mp`, and on a missing project): variadic
  signatures from the callers (format literal + va_start), the 2007 CRT named (sprintf, _snprintf, sscanf,
  vsprintf, _vsnprintf, _output), mp.dll's UTIL_VarArgs/UTIL_LogPrintf/VoiceServerDebug, __chkstk with the
  alloca_probe fixup, gEngfuncs/IEngineStudio/pmove and g_engfuncs/gpGlobals/gFunctionTable/pmove typed from the
  SDK headers, and a call-site prototype for every literal-format variadic call. 0x10001000 now reads
  sprintf(buf, "{shot%i", RandomLong(0, 4) + 1). ScanVarargs.java + varargs-ports.py list the ports to check.
- Mismatches found and fixed: TS's UpdateSpectatorPanel (0x10063870) mode line "#Spec_Mode%d : %s" with the
  target's name, "#Spec_Only_Help" for HLTV, no "#Spec_Auto"; the missing-sprite line "WARNING! cannot found
  %s\n" (0x10050a53); RespawnFlag (@0x9de58) unsigned team test (a neutral flag goes home silently), no full
  stop and no "The", held 30; the return line announces 5 (@0x9e49e), held 30; TSGetPointsForFrag's feed line
  doubles the shown points for a streak over 8 and a kill within 2 s (0x7956e). Puppet-tested on reTS and
  TS 3.0 (tsx-ts3 ts_flag_return, ts_kills).
- Found, not changed: the server project (re.sh) still drops varargs (ApplyTypes skips "...", engine_fn).

## 2026-10-10: game description back to TS 3.0's (e9c12bc6 reverted)
- The " [reTS]" suffix is gone: TSX tests the description against "The Specialists (The One)" exactly to
  find The One mode, so the suffix turned its The One scoring off (tsx_one: "kill of the one scores
  nothing", "kill by the new one"). The description is part of what server plugins read; the live server
  is told apart by its hostname ("goldsrc.net The Specialists", infra deploy-gameserver step 2c).

## 2026-10-10: client state across a server change, and the shoot animation
- c23fa288: the client weapons are set up again on every map as client.dll does (team menu Initialize
  0x10065ff0 clears 0x1009ff08; HUD_InitClientWeapons 0x100036f0 reruns compile_weapons_info and the gun's
  Spawn, whose Precache refetches the event indices). TS 3.0 and reTS precache the 11 events in different
  orders (measured on ts_lobby: TS 3.0 fire, coldcock, firelinked, empty, pump, closecombat, reload, knife,
  katana, draw, grenade; reTS fire, reload, draw, knife, katana, grenade, coldcock, closecombat, empty, pump,
  firelinked), so a client that came from another server played the wrong events (reload -> coldcock,
  kung fu -> grenade, knife -> closecombat). Also: the gun respawns with the player, the player's Spawn
  resets recoil (0x1000b9d0), the last kick time and the FX root's cl_fx configuration reset per map.
- 5500fd80: StandardFire calls no SendWeaponAnim (neither original does); EV_TSFire plays block[3+RL(0,2)]/
  block[6] and the pump's block[11]/[12]. The predicted shoot against TS 3.0's server (weaponanim stays at the
  draw) made the anim check replay the draw after every shot. Puppet test tsx-ts3 ts_fire_weaponanim.
- dac1e31f, e3b4911b, 3525461c (same day, Steven: fix them): the events are registered in CTSGun::Precache's
  order only (PrecacheAllTSWeapons no longer registers four first), so reTS's indices equal TS 3.0's and
  released clients survive a server change; DefaultDeploy idles 3 s on (0.75 s Contender) and plays
  weapons/draw.wav (CHAN_VOICE, attn 1.25, pitch 98..101), not for kung fu; HUD_PostRunCmd runs
  HUD_WeaponsPostThink whatever cl_lw is. Tests tsx-ts3 ts_event_order, ts_draw.

## 2026-10-10: single-player rules no longer crash (TSGameRules always exists)
- 0a25d422: TSGameRules points at a file-scope static object (ts_player.cpp) in every mode, as the original's
  bss object 0x1681a0 (static init 0x671b4 -> ctor 0x671dc, bullet manager only). InstallGameRules no longer
  NULLs it on the CHalfLifeRules path (0xb6050 clears only g_teamplay). Init runs only from the MP ctor,
  MP::ChangeLevel and the Teamplay ctor, Think only from MP/Teamplay::Think, so under deathmatch 0 the object
  is zero (or the last MP map's); the six non-zero member initializers are gone for that reason. Crash was
  CTSPowerUp::Spawn (also reached by item_longjump's CTSSuperJump::Spawn) reading NULL.
- 6d05ee94: the 51 NULL tests on it are gone; no original site tests the address (each checked, addresses
  in amxxbench docs/fixes/sp-rules-crash-report.md). 37af66f8: CHalfLifeRules execs no spserver.cfg
  (0xce6fc; an HL25 addition).
- Proof: i386 HLDS copy, +maxplayers 1, ts_lobby and crossfire: TS 3.0 and reTS print the same console
  (incl. "All weapons are restricted."), reTS before crashed (core). Full tsx-ts3 646/646 and ts30 258/258,
  deathmatch and teamplay.
- Found, not changed: CHalfLifeMultiplay::PlayerSpawn's GetTeamCash call has no original counterpart (inert
  INTERIM Y9-3); CHalfLifeRules was checked only for spserver.cfg.

## 2026-10-15: mp_teammodels_force (first deliberate cvar deviation)
- TS 3.0's teamplay ClientUserInfoChanged (0xd4d18) re-rolls a random team model on any userinfo change
  (it compares the model to the team name); reTS matched it. A server operator's model plugins fought it.
- New server cvar mp_teammodels_force, default 1 = original. 0 = a model from the player's own team list is
  kept (m_iPlayerModel remembers it); any other is put back to the one he had, not re-rolled. Players stay on
  their own team's set (the first version left any model alone; Steven ruled that out). Recorded in reference/DEVIATIONS.md (new; lists ReTS_GetInterface too).
- Proof: amd64, i386, win32 build; ReHLDS rig registers it as "1" and takes "0". The model behaviour itself
  is not playtested.

## 2026-10-15: the skorpion has no silenced p_ model, as TS 3.0
- 84d4cbd2 had given slot 17 `models/p_tmp_sil.mdl`; Write_skorpion (0x8d3f0) never writes +0x1b2 and the
  original has no such string (dossier-attachments §1 agreed). Effect was an extra precache only (the
  skorpion takes no attachments). Row removed. Proof: amd64 hl.so and client.so build, neither holds the
  string. Cut-content survey (armor powerup, TMP, SPAS 15) in reference/CUT_CONTENT.md.

## 2026-10-15: the Windows server suite, and why a server operator's Windows box crashed
- Reproduced on Windows HLDS under Wine (scripts/test-win-server.sh): with stock AMX Mod X 1.8.2, a Ham
  Killed hook makes reTS crash at map start (CBaseTrigger::HurtTouch, this clobbered): stock TS windows slot
  22 is reTS's TakeDamage, so the two-argument trampoline unbalances the stack. TS 3.0's mp.dll is fine.
- Fixes: hamdata.py --msvc writes reTS's windows slots from clang-cl's MSVC vtable dump (four overloads are
  not linux-1); amxmodx tsx-ts3 d5d0171d carries them. The core must be tsx-ts3's too: gamedll_export
  (5a5e5e8b), which selects the reTS gamedata, is not on public 64bit, so the drop-in's core never selected
  it. scripts/winrig/build-amxx-win.sh builds core + reTSX with clang-cl/xwin; package-win-suite.sh packs
  reTS + Metamod-R + AMX Mod X for Half-Life/ts.
- Proof: rets_ham_probe (hooks fire only on the game's own calls) all five fired on reTS with the suite, as
  on TS 3.0; TSX and model probes pass. Odd: reTSX read free slots 0 once after ts_giveweapon on a fake
  client that never spawned (40 on a later tick); not checked yet.

## 2026-10-15: mp_teammodels_force 0 is off; the team-list mode moves to 2
- 0 now never writes the model key (userinfo changes: both TS 3.0's multiplayer check and the teamplay
  re-roll; team changes: no stamp). 1 is TS 3.0. 2 is the old 0 (own team's list, pick kept). A match
  plugin's class models (not listable in mp_teammodels) were overwritten under the old 0.
- Same day: g_pGameRules exported (Linux visibility, Windows .def) for fakemeta's gamerules natives; the
  AMX Mod X fork's fakemeta info buffer handles fixed (a03e1ba9) after a listen-server crash reading 0x1.
- Proof: rets_model_probe on the Wine rig for 0/1/2 (table in the commit), rets_infobuffer_probe,
  rets_ham_probe, rets_changelevel_probe, rets_probe all pass on the suite.

## 2026-10-22: env_fade's Restrict Area (spawnflag 8), and a spawnflags audit
- TS's CFade (Spawn__5CFade @0xad68c, Use @0xad7d0) is a brush entity: SET_MODEL, its size, EF_NODRAW,
  MOVETYPE_FLY, not solid. Its Use with spawnflag 8 fades only the clients in its bounds
  (UTIL_EntitiesInBox, 32, FL_CLIENT), ahead of 4 (activator only). reTS had Half-Life's point-entity
  CFade with no 8. ts_neobaroque uses it on 11 env_fades (spawnflags 9, lightning flashes per area).
- Found from the GMod port's FGD comparison (ts_fgd.fgd flag 8 "Restrict Area"). coverage.py checks FGD
  keys against KeyValue handlers but not flags, so this passed every report.
- New scripts/coverage/spawnflags.py -> reference/coverage/SPAWNFLAGS.md: the FGD's flag bits each
  entity's class chain tests against pev->spawnflags in ts_i386.so and in reTS's i386 build. Machine-code
  pattern matching, so 38 rows were misses either way; each was read in the source and listed with its
  evidence in reference/coverage/spawnflags_checked.tsv. Now 0 missing, 0 extra.
- Proof: builds (i386, amd64); CFade::Use calls UTIL_EntitiesInBox; spawnflags.py clean. Built, not yet
  checked in the engine (needs a client inside a neobaroque fade brush).
