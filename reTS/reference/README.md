# reference/ — original "ts" (The Specialists) artifacts

Source-of-truth binaries from the original mod. **Goal: an ABI-compatible
rebuild of both the server and client libs** as compilable C++ on top of this
SDK fork — same exported symbols, vtable layouts, struct sizes and calling
conventions, so the result is drop-in / network-compatible with the original.
**Reference only — not linked into any build.**

| File | What it is | Reconstruction value |
|---|---|---|
| `ts_i386.so` | Linux 32-bit **server** dll, GCC 2.96, **not stripped** | Full function inventory (2,426 funcs) + addresses; loads into Ghidra/IDA with names auto-applied. STABS present but only for libgcc/CRT — no source lines/locals for mod code. |
| `mp.dll` | Windows 32-bit **server** dll, MSVC | Exports **159 MSVC-mangled** symbols → **fully-typed** signatures (return, params, `__thiscall`, const). The server-side ABI spine. |
| `client.dll` | Windows 32-bit **client** dll, MSVC | Exports **~1,013 MSVC-mangled** symbols incl. the HL client engine interface (`HUD_*`, `ClientFactory`) and VGUI. The client-side ABI spine. |
| `ts_fgd.fgd` | Worldcraft/Hammer entity definitions | Entity classnames, keyvalues, spawnflags, I/O — maps editor-facing names to the `CTS*` classes for free. |

## Regenerating the signature data

```bash
./dump-signatures.sh        # needs llvm-undname (llvm) + binutils
```

Produces, in this folder:
- `signatures-mp.txt` / `signatures-client.txt` — demangled, fully-typed signatures (server / client)
- `exports-mp.raw` / `exports-client.raw` — raw mangled export names
- `symbols-gcc2.txt` — `addr  name` for every defined function in `ts_i386.so`
- `classes.txt` — distinct class names + method counts (across both dlls)

## Notes / gotchas

- This binutils `c++filt` **cannot** demangle GCC 2.x (`gnu-v2`) names, so the
  `.so` names are kept raw. They're still readable — `Foo__3BarPi` = `Bar::Foo(int*)`
  — and the MSVC side gives the clean typed form for the same functions.
- `mp.dll` exports only 159 of the ~2,400 functions; use `ts_i386.so` for the
  **complete** inventory and the `.fgd` for the entity surface.
- The mod is built on the open HL SDK (this repo's base). Reconstruction =
  diff the symbol set against stock HLSDK, then decompile only the `CTS*` /
  weapon / slow-motion delta.

## Provenance

Copied from `~/Packages/xash3d-fwgs/rodir/ts/` (a prior iteration's runtime
tree).

**Authorization:** the original author (Vino / "Vinoisnotozou") gave the
project owner the go-ahead to reconstruct the mod. The original source is
lost and irrecoverable — recovering it from these shipped binaries is the
only remaining path.
