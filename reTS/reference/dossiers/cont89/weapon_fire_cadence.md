# cont89 — Weapon fire-cadence + accuracy prediction (clip flicker / semi-auto / spread)

**Symptom (original TS `client.dll` → OUR `hl.so`), firing a gun:**
1. Clip **flickers 19↔20** during fire, snaps correct only on reload.
2. **Full-auto acts like semi** — one shot per click instead of hold-to-fire.
3. **Absurd bullet spread** — the dynamic cone walks all the way out.

**One root: fire-cadence/state desync.** The original client's weapon prediction is faithful
and shares source with the original server, so it predicts *exactly what the original server
would produce*. Every symptom is the original client mispredicting because OUR server puts a
different fire cadence / clip / fire-mode on the wire (and in its own timing) than the original
server did. RE'd on both sides: server `reference/ts_i386.so` (symboled), client
`reference/client.dll` (no symbols; binmap + typed-`this` decompile).

Addresses: server as `nm` / `(Ghidra=nm+0x10000)`. Client as `client.dll` RVA.

## The prediction contract (how the original client stays in sync)

The engine sends the player a full `clientdata_t` every frame. The DLL packs the **active
weapon's predicted state into the clientdata `vuser` fields** in the global
`UpdateClientData(edict, sendweapons, clientdata)` — `0xa0294 / 0xb0294`, `/* client.cpp */`.
Verified field map (`clientdata_t`: vuser1@0x1ac, vuser2@0x1b8, vuser3@0x1c4, vuser4@0x1d0):

| clientdata | src (original) | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| vuser3[0] 0x1c4 | `CTSGun+0xc8` (m_weaponType) | active weapon type |
| vuser3[1] 0x1c8 | `activeItem+2`  | **fireMode** (0 AUTO … 5 AKIMBO_BOTH) |
| vuser3[2] 0x1cc | `activeItem+0x10` | attach mask |
| vuser4[0] 0x1d0 | `activeItem+0x24` | altMode |
| **vuser4[1] 0x1d4** | **`activeItem+4`** | **CLIP (live)** |
| vuser4[2] 0x1d8 | `activeItem+0xc` | leftClip |
| vuser2[0] 0x1b8 | `activeItem+8`  | bloody |
| vuser1[2] 0x1b4 | `activeItem+0x14` | active-attach |

`activeItem` = the current `s_weapon_status` in the m_items arsenal (`CTSGun+0xcc`). Our server
writes the **same offsets** (`dlls/client.cpp:2163-2175`, `cd->vuser3.x/.y … cd->vuser4.y`) using
the flat live members (`m_weaponType/m_fireMode/m_iClip`) — packing verified correct.

**Client side — `HUD_WeaponsPostThink` (`client.dll FUN_10003830`, via `HUD_PostRunCmd` RVA
0x45b0):** re-seeds the predicted active weapon **from these `from`-clientdata vuser fields EVERY
FRAME** (weaponType `= __ftol(from.vuser3[0])`, then into a global `s_weapon_status`
`DAT_1009f33c + type*0x30`: +2=fireMode, +4=clip, +0x10=attach, +0x24=altMode…), runs the
predicted `ItemPostFrame`, then writes the result back to `to` at the same offsets.

> **This is the flicker mechanism.** The clip is client-predicted (StandardFire does `clip--`)
> AND authoritatively re-seeded from `vuser4[1]` every frame. If, on any frame, the server's
> `vuser4[1]` does not equal the client's predicted clip, the seed **reverts** the predicted 19
> back to 20 next frame → **19↔20**. They must agree frame-for-frame, which means our server must
> fire/decrement on exactly the frames the client predicts.

## (a) Fire cadence + clip — original vs ours

**`CTSGun::StandardFire` (`0x724a4 / 0x824a4`), one shot:**
```
ShootBulletsPlayer(...)                       // bullets FIRST
if (!InfiniteClips) activeItem->iClip--        // decrement gated by InfiniteClips
bparam1 = (activeItem->iClip == 0)
PlaybackEvent(m_usFire, …, weaponType, activeItem->attach, bparam1, player+0x7ec /*seed*/)
if      (fireMode == BURST) rate = 0.03; if (burstOrPhase==1) rate = 0.2   // fast, 0.2 last
else if (fireMode == SEMI && (activeInfo->iFireModes & 1)) rate = 0.1       // ← SEMI+has-AUTO: FIXED 0.1
else    rate = activeInfo->flFireRate
CTSGun+0x9c (m_flNextPrimaryAttack) = WeaponTimeBase() + rate
CTSGun+0xa8 (m_flTimeWeaponIdle)    = WeaponTimeBase() + 2.0   (0.5 for wpn 0x24 when dry)
```
Client `StandardFire` (`FUN_100091e0`) does the identical thing: `activeItem->iClip--` (+ the
m_items-global copy `type*0x30+0x108`), the event, and `weapon+0x8c (m_flNextPrimaryAttack) =
time + rate` with the **same** rate ladder (burst 0.2/0.03, **semi+flag 0.1**, else `flFireRate
@activeInfo+0x18`). So the client predicts 0.1s cadence for a dual-mode weapon in semi.

**Two clip fields in the original — do NOT conflate:**
- `activeItem->iClip` (`activeItem+4`) — the LIVE fire clip. Decremented in StandardFire; sent
  via **vuser4[1]** (the prediction seed) and used by `WeaponIdle`.
- `CTSGun::m_iClip` (`CTSGun+0xb4`, stock `CBasePlayerWeapon::m_iClip`) — the **weapon_data**
  channel (`GetWeaponData 0xa00ac/0xb00ac` packs `weapon_data.m_iClip = gun+0xb4`). It is set
  **only** in `WeaponIdle` (`0x754dc/0x854dc`: `this->m_iClip = activeItem->iClip;`) and to `1`
  in Spawn. During sustained fire, StandardFire pushes `m_flTimeWeaponIdle +2s`, so `WeaponIdle`
  does **not** run → `gun+0xb4` stays **stale** (last idle value). i.e. the original's
  `weapon_data.m_iClip` is *stable during fire*.

**Ours (divergences):**
- `dlls/ts_gun.cpp:1058` `m_iClip--` is **unconditional** (original gates on `!InfiniteClips`),
  and runs **before** `ShootBulletsPlayer` (original: after). Cosmetic ordering; the
  InfiniteClips gate is a real (rare) divergence.
- `dlls/ts_gun.cpp:1119-1133` rate = `wi->flFireRate` only — **missing the `SEMI && (iFireModes
  & 1) → 0.1` special case.** For a dual-mode weapon in semi, the client predicts 0.1s but our
  server re-arms at `flFireRate` (e.g. 0.054) → the two disagree on the next eligible-fire frame
  → the server accepts/rejects a shot the client didn't/did → clip diverges by one → flicker +
  over/under-count. **This is the top concrete cadence divergence.** (`ts_gun.cpp` is shared —
  fixing StandardFire fixes both hl.so and client.so.)
- We **conflate** the two clips: `m_iClip` is our live clip AND the `weapon_data.m_iClip` source
  (`dlls/client.cpp:1998 item->m_iClip = gun->m_iClip`). So our `weapon_data.m_iClip`
  **decrements live** every shot, whereas the original's is WeaponIdle-synced/stale. Our
  `WeaponIdle` (`ts_gun.cpp:2715+`) does not mirror the clip into a separate `weapon_data`
  field (comment admits it). This is a second authoritative clip on the wire that the original
  client does not expect to move during fire.

**`gmsgWeaponInfo` (the HUD ammo message) — `CTSGun::UpdateClientData 0x758c8/0x858c8`:** the
original sends it **only when weaponType or reserve changes** (`bVar1 = (m_weaponType != cache)
|| (reserve != cache)`), NOT on clip change — so it is **silent during fire** (reserve only
changes on reload). The clip byte it carries is a cached snapshot. During fire the HUD clip is
therefore the **predicted** weapon state; the message re-syncs it on reload/switch → *"syncs
only on reload."* **Ours over-sends:** `dlls/ts_gun.cpp:2448` includes `clipByte ==
m_iClientClip` in the change gate, so we emit `WeaponInfo` on **every** clip change — spamming a
redundant authoritative clip during fire.

---

## (b) Semi vs auto gate — MATCHES (both sides), so verify the DATA

`CTSGun::PrimaryAttack` (`0x71a20 / 0x81a20`) gates on `activeItem->fireMode`:
- **mode 0 AUTO / 5 AKIMBO_BOTH → fall straight to `Fire()`** = fire every held frame.
- **mode 1 SEMI / 4 AKIMBO_ALT → fire only if `m_afButtonPressed & IN_ATTACK` (fresh press) OR
  `DoubleFireRate`** = one shot per press (held-continuous only with the bullet-time powerup).
- mode 2 BURST (sets `burstOrPhase`, on `player+0x814 & 1`); mode 3 PUMP (`pev->button & 1`).

Client `PrimaryAttack` (`FUN_100089a0`, reached from `ItemPostFrame FUN_1000b7b0` when `(button
& IN_ATTACK) && weapon+0x8c <= time`) reads `activeItem+2` and gates **byte-identically**.

Our `CTSGun::PrimaryAttack` (`dlls/ts_gun.cpp:944-988`) is equivalent (AUTO/AKIMBO_BOTH/PUMP →
`held`; SEMI/AKIMBO_ALT → `pressed`; DoubleFireRate → `held`). Enum
(`dlls/ts_weapon_info.h:263`) matches: AUTO=0, SEMI=1, BURST=2, PUMP=3, AKIMBO_ALT=4,
AKIMBO_BOTH=5.

⇒ The gate logic is NOT inverted. "Full-auto acts like semi" therefore means the **mode value on
the wire is SEMI(1) when it should be AUTO(0).** The client predicts semi iff `vuser3[1]==1`.
Our `vuser3[1] = tsgun->m_fireMode`, set on deploy to `TSDefaultFireMode(wi->iFireModes)`
(`dlls/ts_gun.cpp:316`; "auto if offered, else pump, else burst, else semi"). If a weapon's
`iFireModes` mask in our table (`dlls/ts_weapon_info.cpp`) lacks the AUTO bit (`1<<TSFM_AUTO ==
1`), `TSDefaultFireMode` returns SEMI and **both** sides gate semi (self-consistent, so no
flicker — but wrong). **Action: audit each auto weapon's `iFireModes` against the original.**
(If instead our server keeps m_fireMode AUTO but the *cadence* desync above starves the fire
loop, that shows as flicker, not clean semi — so clean semi is a data/mask bug, flicker is a
cadence bug. They can co-occur.)

---

## (c) Spread accumulator — client-predicted-only, downstream of cadence

`CTSGun::ScaleSpread` (`0x702a8 / 0x802a8`): folds a per-player accumulator into this shot's
cone, then grows it; recovers per-shot by time-since-last-shot and again per-frame in PreThink.
- Storage: **`CBasePlayer+0x778`** (server) — our `m_flSpreadAccum` (`dlls/player.h:401`). Client
  copy at **`player+0x764`**, last-shot time at `weapon+0x8a0` (our `m_flLastShotTime`,
  `ts_gun.h:178`). Logic byte-identical (0.875 silenced base; factor 2 ×0.5 doublefire ×0.775
  sil; recovery `GiveSlowMul(player)*dt` capped 0.5; accum capped 0.1) — matches
  `dlls/ts_gun.cpp:1194`.
- **Per-frame recovery** in `CBasePlayer::PreThink` (`0x808cc/0x908cc`): `if (accum>0) accum -=
  GiveSlowMul*frametime*0.1; clamp 0`. Ours matches (`dlls/player.cpp:1921-1925`).
- **NOT networked.** `UpdateClientData` never writes `player+0x778` into any clientdata field,
  and the client confirms **no seed** of `player+0x764` in the postthink — the accumulator is
  **purely client-predicted**. The client's weapon prediction runs StandardFire (grows it) but
  does **not** run `CBasePlayer::PreThink` (server-only think) — so the client does NOT predict
  the per-frame recovery. It stays in sync with the server **only because the client fires the
  identical shots** (the per-shot recovery inside ScaleSpread, which the client DOES run, keeps
  it bounded when cadence matches).

⇒ **Spread blow-out is downstream.** When the cadence desync (a/b) makes the client predict
extra shots, its accumulator over-grows with no server correction → the cone walks out.
Server-side spread stays correct (our PreThink recovery works). **Fix the cadence and the spread
self-corrects — the accumulator needs no networking.** (Note: server bullets use a fresh
`random_seed = RandomLong(0,32000)` set each `CBasePlayer::ItemPostFrame 0xcc4d0/0xdc4d0` into
`player+0x7ec`, so the exact pellet *pattern* is server-authoritative and not client-predictable
— that is cosmetic and separate from the cone size.)

---

## (d) Reconciliation plan (make the original client predict our server exactly)

The seed channel `vuser4[1]`/`vuser3[1]` and the gate are already correct; the fixes make our
server's fire *cadence and clip channels* byte-faithful so the every-frame re-seed always equals
the prediction. `ts_gun.cpp` compiles into BOTH libs, so StandardFire fixes cover our client too.

**Priority 1 — fire rate (the concrete cadence divergence).** In `CTSGun::StandardFire`
(`dlls/ts_gun.cpp:1119-1133`) add the original's semi-with-auto special case before the default:
```
if (m_fireMode == TSFM_BURST) { … 0.03 / 0.2 … }
else if (m_fireMode == TSFM_SEMI && (wi->iFireModes & (1<<TSFM_AUTO))) flRate = 0.1f;  // NEW
else flRate = wi->flFireRate > 0 ? wi->flFireRate : 0.15f;
```
Also review the BURST ladder to match the original's `burstOrPhase==1 → 0.2` test (ours uses
`<=0`).

**Priority 2 — fire-mode data audit.** Verify each auto weapon's `iFireModes` mask in
`dlls/ts_weapon_info.cpp` includes `1<<TSFM_AUTO` so `TSDefaultFireMode` yields AUTO(0). Any
auto weapon defaulting to SEMI(1) fires "like semi" on both sides. Cross-check against the
original's `compile_weapons_info` mask values.

**Priority 3 — clip channels: mirror the original's stable-during-fire behaviour.**
- `weapon_data.m_iClip`: stop sending the live clip. Keep a separate cache synced only in
  `CTSGun::WeaponIdle` (`this-><cache> = m_iClip`, like the original `gun+0xb4 = activeItem->iClip`)
  and pack THAT into `weapon_data.m_iClip` (`dlls/client.cpp:1998`). Leave `vuser4[1]` = live
  `m_iClip` (the real prediction seed).
- `gmsgWeaponInfo` change gate (`dlls/ts_gun.cpp:2448`): drop `clipByte` from the comparison —
  send only on **weaponType or reserve** change, matching `CTSGun::UpdateClientData 0x858c8`. The
  clip byte still rides the message; it just stops re-emitting every shot.

**Priority 4 — decrement fidelity.** Gate the `m_iClip--` on `!InfiniteClips` and order it after
`ShootBulletsPlayer` (match `StandardFire 0x824a4`). Low impact but part of drop-in exactness.

**Verification (live A/B — user drives).** After P1/P2, if any residual flicker remains, confirm
the exact frame with a live trace (the user keeps original TS in `hl.exe`; see CLAUDE.md §4b):
`binmap.py CTSGun::StandardFire` → `live.py break mp.dll 0x<rva>` (or a caller if string-poor),
fire one shot, read `activeItem->iClip` (`activeItem+4`) and `m_flNextPrimaryAttack`
(`gun+0x9c`); compare against our server's `m_iClip`/`m_flNextPrimaryAttack` for the same
usercmd. Equal values on the same frame = the vuser4[1] re-seed matches the prediction = no
flicker. Do the same for a full-auto weapon to confirm `vuser3[1]==0` and continuous fire.

---

## (e) Reload prediction — anim-not-playing + post-reload clip flicker (the missing reserve channel)

After the Priority-1 rate fix, **fresh-spawn firing is clean**, but two reload bugs remain:
(1) after a reload the 20↔19 flicker returns while firing; (2) the reload **animation doesn't
play** for the local player. Both are **one cause: the client can't predict the reload because
the active weapon's spare-ammo reserve is not on the wire.**

**How the reload works (original, both sides run this identical code):**
- `+reload` → base `CBasePlayerWeapon::ItemPostFrame` (`0x903d4/0xa03d4`) IN_RELOAD branch →
  `CTSGun::Reload` (`0x74d5c/0x84d5c`). `Reload` **early-returns if
  `m_ammoReserve[activeInfo->iCaliber] < 1`**; otherwise it `ReloadWeapon`s (arm), sets idle +5,
  `Unzoom`, and **`PlaybackEvent(FEV_NOTHOST, m_usReload, …, weaponType, activeItem->attach, …)`**
  + 3rd-person `Animate(TSA_RELOAD=0x33)`.
- `CTSGun::ReloadWeapon` (`0x74a14/0x84a14`): needs `m_ammoReserve[caliber] > 0` and
  `take = min(clipSize - clip, reserve) > 0`; sets `activeItem->m_fInReload (activeItem+0xc)=1`
  and locks the countdown `player->m_flNextAttack (player+0x12c) = WeaponTimeBase()+flReloadTime`
  (UseDecrement ⇒ `WeaponTimeBase()==0` ⇒ a **relative countdown**, decremented per frame).
- **The refill** completes back in `CBasePlayerWeapon::ItemPostFrame` when the countdown elapses
  (`activeItem->m_fInReload!=0 && WeaponTimeBase() >= player->m_flNextAttack`, i.e. countdown ≤0):
  `take = min(activeInfo->iClip - activeItem->iClip, m_ammoReserve[caliber])`;
  `activeItem->iClip += take` (the LIVE clip → vuser4[1]); `this->m_iClip = activeItem->iClip`
  (syncs the gun+0xb4 weapon_data channel); `m_ammoReserve[caliber] -= take`;
  `activeItem->m_fInReload = 0`. **Ammo source = `m_ammoReserve[caliber]` (gun+0xd4 array), never
  stock `m_rgAmmo`.**

**Why FEV_NOTHOST still shows the anim on the local player:** the event is sent with
`FEV_NOTHOST`, so the **server skips the owning (host) player** — the host only sees the reload
viewmodel anim if **its own client predicts `Reload()`** and fires the same `PlaybackEvent`
locally (EV_TSReload plays the viewmodel block). If the client's predicted `Reload()`
early-returns, no local event ⇒ **no anim**.

**Root cause — the reserve isn't networked.** For the client to predict the reload it needs
`m_ammoReserve[activeInfo->iCaliber]` in its predicted CTSGun (gun+0xd4). The original ships it
in **`clientdata.vuser2[1]` (cd+0x1bc)**: the global `UpdateClientData` (`0xb0294`) writes
`cd+0x1bc = *(gun+0xd4 + activeInfo->iCaliber*4)` = the active caliber's reserve. Everything else
the reload needs is already present: `activeItem->iClip` (vuser4[1]), the countdown
`m_flNextAttack` (cd+0x7c — `dlls/client.cpp:2122`, client seeds/decrements at
`hl_weapons.cpp:657/888`), `m_fInReload` (predicted client-side + echoed in weapon_data), and the
static `activeInfo->iClip`.

**Our bug:** the TSGUN vuser block (`dlls/client.cpp:2166-2176`) sets `vuser2.x` (bloody) but
**never `vuser2.y`** (the reserve), and the client (`cl_dll/hl/hl_weapons.cpp:609-622`) never
reads `from->client.vuser2[1]`. So the client's `g_TSGun.m_ammoReserve[caliber]` stays **0** ⇒
predicted `CTSGun::Reload` early-returns (`ts_gun.cpp:2591` `m_ammoReserve[caliber] < 1`) ⇒
**no reload event/anim (bug 2)** and **no predicted refill**; the client's clip is never refilled
locally, so post-reload it re-seeds/fights the server's refilled `vuser4[1]` ⇒ **20↔19 flicker
(bug 1)**. (The invented vuser ammo channel that was removed had been feeding the client's
ammo — its correct replacement, the single `vuser2[1]` reserve, was never added.)

**Fix (concrete; `ts_gun.cpp`/`Reload` unchanged — they already match the original):**
1. **Server** — in the `TSGUN_WEAPON_ID` block (`dlls/client.cpp:2166`), add the reserve channel:
   ```
   const s_weapon_info* awi = get_weapon_info((tsweapon_t)wt);
   const int cal = awi->iCaliber;
   cd->vuser2.y = (float)((cal > 0 && cal < TS_NUM_CALIBERS) ? tsgun->m_ammoReserve[cal] : 0); // cd+0x1bc
   ```
2. **Client** — in `HUD_WeaponsPostThink`'s TS read (`cl_dll/hl/hl_weapons.cpp` ~609), seed the
   active caliber's reserve so the predicted `Reload()`/refill runs:
   ```
   const s_weapon_info* awi = get_weapon_info((tsweapon_t)wt);
   if (awi->iCaliber > 0 && awi->iCaliber < TS_NUM_CALIBERS)
       g_TSGun.m_ammoReserve[awi->iCaliber] = (int)from->client.vuser2[1];
   ```
   and mirror it in the write-back next to the other TS fields (~832):
   `to->client.vuser2[1] = (float)g_TSGun.m_ammoReserve[awi->iCaliber];` (inside the TSGUN block —
   the `CRpg` path that also uses `vuser2[1]` is a different active weapon, so no clash).

Result: the client predicts `Reload()` (reserve>0 → event fires locally → **anim plays**) and the
predicted refill matches the server's, so `vuser4[1]` re-seed equals the prediction ⇒ **no
post-reload flicker**. The gmsgWeaponInfo reserve display is separate (change-detected, sent on
the reserve change at reload) and already correct.

---

## (f) The reload REFILL/DEBIT — server byte-correct; client must full-set (cont.89d)

After the vuser2[1] reserve channel landed, the FIRST reload works but everything after it breaks
(fire stops decrementing, no further reload anim). RE'd the refill on both sides to settle where
the clip is filled and the reserve debited:

**SERVER refill — objdump-PROVEN byte-identical to the original** (`CBasePlayerWeapon::ItemPostFrame`
`0x903d4/0xa03d4`, gated `activeItem->m_fInReload!=0 && WeaponTimeBase()>=player->m_flNextAttack`):
```
0x90514 need   = activeInfo->iClip - activeItem->iClip
0x90520 esi    = m_ammoReserve[activeInfo->iCaliber]
0x90527 cmp/jle/mov  esi = min(need, reserve)          // take
0x90539 add %esi, activeItem->iClip                    // clip += take   (NOT a full-mag SET)
0x90609 mov activeItem->iClip -> gun+0xb4 (m_iClip)    // sync weapon_data channel
0x9061f sub %esi, m_ammoReserve[caliber]               // reserve -= take (SINGLE debit)
0x90632 mov $0, activeItem->m_fInReload                // clear
```
Ammo source is **`m_ammoReserve[caliber]`, not stock `m_rgAmmo`** (0x90520). `DoReload`/`ReloadWeapon`
(`0x84a14`) only ARMS (m_fInReload + the countdown lock) — no debit, no clip change. **Our
`weapons_shared.cpp:164-191` matches this exactly.** ⇒ **Do NOT change the server to a full-mag SET** —
a partial reload with `reserve < need` must stay partial; a SET over-fills and drives the reserve
negative. The coordinator directive's "server does the stock m_rgAmmo refill / must full-set" premise
is incorrect: the server already does the TS-correct `clip += min(need, reserve)` + `m_ammoReserve`
debit.

**CLIENT refill — the divergence (fork raw-disasm of `client.dll`, `FUN_1000b7b0`):** the original
client's completion is an **optimistic FULL-MAG SET `activeItem->iClip = activeInfo->iClip` with NO
reserve arithmetic and NO debit** — the reserve is server-authoritative, re-seeded from
`clientdata.vuser2[1]` every frame (`HUD_WeaponsPostThink` reads `from+0x1bc` → `m_ammoReserve[iCaliber]`,
iCaliber = winfo+8 on BOTH the seed and the read — the earlier "+2" was a Ghidra mislabel). **OUR
refill is SHARED (`weapons_shared.cpp`) and ran `clip += min` + `reserve -= take` on the CLIENT too**,
so our client predicted a reserve debit the original client never does. **Fix (committed):** guard
the refill — `#ifdef CLIENT_DLL` full-set + no debit (match the original client); `#else` the
byte-correct server `clip += min(need,reserve)` + debit. (`dlls/weapons_shared.cpp:164-207`.)

**Status of the "breaks-after-first-reload" symptom.** The server path is byte-correct and the
reserve wire (`vuser2.y`, single writer, sent every frame) is clean; the reserve seed is `clip*3`
capped at `iMaxCarry` (~60 for 9mm), the akimbo mirror indices are all in-bounds (2→8/3→16/9→10/
14→30/17→37), timers are floored (`slowFrametime ≥ 0.01*frametime`, so `m_flNextAttack` always
counts down), and there is no double-debit or `vuser2.y` clobber. Analytically, an ORIGINAL client
against this server should reload repeatedly. So the residual symptom (if it persists on the original
client) is a **runtime** state issue not visible in the static code — settle it with a live gdb read.

**Live gdb probe (our hl.so, amd64 — offsets recovered from `CTSGun::ReloadWeapon` @0x112c90 +
`CBasePlayerWeapon::ItemPostFrame` @0x12fff0):** `m_iClip`=gun+0xec, `m_ammoReserve[]`=gun+0xaa0,
`m_fInReload`=gun+0xf8 (byte), `m_pActiveInfo`=gun+0xa98 (iCaliber=info+0x94), `m_pPlayer`=gun+0xb8
(`m_flNextAttack`=player+0x2e4). Break `*&'CTSGun::ReloadWeapon(int, int, float)'` (this=%rdi) for
the arm, and `*(&'CBasePlayerWeapon::ItemPostFrame()'+0x20f)` (this=%rbx) for the completion; print
`clip / caliber / m_ammoReserve[cal] / m_fInReload / m_flNextAttack` at each. Reload 2-3× on the
original client and compare — if the server's clip/reserve/m_fInReload are correct after each
completion, the bug is client/wire, not the server refill. (ptrace_scope=1 blocks attaching to a
non-descendant PID; run the server as a gdb child, or `sysctl kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=0` for the read.)
