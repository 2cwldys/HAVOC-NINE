# steam-pair.sh <commit>: build reTS's i386 server and client at <commit> and install them as a matching
# pair into a Steam Half-Life ts/ folder, for testing a build (or bisecting) in a real client under the
# native Linux engine: dlls/ts.so, ts_i386.so and ts_i686.so (the Steam engine loads ts.so, see CLAUDE.md
# on gamedll_linux) and cl_dlls/client.so. Windows files (mp.dll, client.dll) are left as they are, so
# test with hl_linux, not hl.exe. Restart Half-Life after each install.
#
# The build runs in its own detached worktree (build-steam-pair/wt, gitignored), so the main checkout
# stays as it is. Set aside the files you want to go back to before the first install.
#
#   STEAM_TS  the ts/ folder (default ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life/ts)

# Resolve the commit in this checkout: inside the worktree HEAD would be the last pair built.
