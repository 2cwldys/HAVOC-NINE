# setup-rehlds-mod.sh — deploy OUR reconstructed server gamedll (hl.so) into the
# local ReHLDS dedicated-server rig so we can run a real client/server test: a
# ReHLDS dedicated server running OUR hl.so, joined by the xash graphical client
# running OUR client.so (see setup-xash-mod.sh). This is the true drop-in swap
# test — our server + our client speaking the reconstructed protocol.
#
# The rig loads the gamedll THROUGH metamod (so rcbot keeps working):
#   ts/liblist.gam         → gamedll_linux "addons/metamod/dlls/metamod_amd64.so"
#   ts/addons/metamod/config.ini → gamedll dlls/hl.so   ← metamod loads OUR hl.so
# so we only need to drop hl.so at ts/dlls/hl.so (+ delta.lst/sprites for wire
# parity). Pass NOMETAMOD=1 to instead point liblist directly at our hl.so
# (bypasses metamod/rcbot — a cleaner isolation of our gamedll).
#
# Re-run after rebuilding (scripts/build.sh amd64) to refresh the server lib.

# --- wire table: deploy OUR merged delta.lst to the rig ----------------------
# network/delta.lst is the MERGED table: the original TS wire fields (iuser3/iuser4 etc.)
# 3-way-merged from the 1998 SDK seed with the anniversary/HL25 fixes (eflags flesh-sound,
# wider skin/m_iId/iuser2). It's the correct table for our server — a minimal WIDENING of the
# original TS table, so it stays drop-in with the original client (GoldSrc transmits the
# server's table at connect, and widening is decode-safe) while keeping the modern engine fixes.
# Use --remove-destination: the rig's ts/delta.lst starts as a SYMLINK into the pristine
# ~/Containers/hlds/mods/ts; a plain `cp -f` would follow it and write THROUGH, clobbering the
# shared original. --remove-destination REPLACES the symlink with a real file in the rig instead.
cp -f --remove-destination "$MODTS/network/delta.lst" "$TS/delta.lst"
# (No generated sprites are deployed — the scope now paints the ORIGINAL quarterscope.spr at
#  render time; ts_scopefull.spr was removed. quarterscope resolves via the ts/sprites symlink.)
