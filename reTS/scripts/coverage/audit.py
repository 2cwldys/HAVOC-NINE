audit.py — check OUR reconstruction against the RE'd original structure (ts_inventory.json), BOTH directions,
at FILE / CLASS / METHOD level. Answers "did we invent something they don't have, or miss something they do?"

  MISSING  = in the original (json) but NOT in our build  -> reconstruction work-list.
  INVENTED = in OUR build but NOT in the original          -> flag for review (a helper we added, a wrong
             file/class placement, or a genuine fabrication vs the RE). Per the mission, drop-in fidelity
             means our structure should map onto the original's; invented symbols are where we drifted.

Scope: TS-SPECIFIC classes only (the reconstruction). Stock SDK classes are skipped — we build on the newer
Itanium SDK whose stock method set legitimately differs from the original's 2007 gcc2 SDK, so diffing those
is noise (that's what divergence.py is for). The json marks ts_specific.

Sources: ORIGINAL from reference/coverage/ts_inventory.json (file->class->methods/members, authoritative — run
run.py/export.py first). OURS from `nm build-amd64/{dlls/hl.so,cl_dll/client.so} | c++filt` (methods) + a source
scan of dlls/ + cl_dll/ (class->our file). Methods matched by NAME (overloads collapse), ctors/dtors ignored.
