REM  build.bat -- build and deploy the TS match mode
REM
REM  THIS FOLDER IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
REM  Edit the .sma and .cfg here. This script syncs them into the game folder,
REM  compiles, and deploys the .amxx to plugins.
REM
REM  Why: a second copy of the source lived inside the game folder and the two
REM  drifted apart, so a build thousands of bytes behind the fixes was being
REM  tested for hours. Copy-then-compile makes that impossible.
REM
REM  Usage:  build.bat | build.bat ts_matchmode | build.bat all
REM
REM  A plugin whose source (and every include it pulls in) is the one its last build was made from is NOT compiled again: the AMX
REM  Mod X compiler writes a different file every time, so a recompile changes the plugin's SHA-256 and the official preset has to be
REM  approved again. tools\amxx-needs-build.ps1 keeps the fingerprint beside each compiled\<name>.amxx (<name>.amxx.src).
REM  Set BUILD_FORCE=1 to compile everything regardless:   set BUILD_FORCE=1 & build.bat

REM (the sudden-death sting and the join jingle). A precached name with no file behind

REM They are WAVs, played with playvol on a normal sound channel so the ambient
REM mp3 queue keeps playing underneath -- an mp3 anthem hard-cut the one mp3
REM stream. The original mp3s still ship beside them as the reference masters.

REM ---- rcbot's own quota config ---------------------------------------------
REM RCBot keeps its OWN bot settings: "config max_bots" inside bot_config.ini is
REM what actually fills the server with bots. The plugin only ever pushed the
REM quota when bots were being turned OFF, so with bots ON rcbot booted to
REM whatever its last shutdown had saved -- which is why an edited max_bots kept
REM "resetting back" to 20. tsm_bots in ts_matchmode.cfg is the master count and
REM the plugin now forces it on rcbot every boot; this syncs the file too, so the
REM disk agrees. rcbot loads it from the Half-Life root (metamod line:
REM ..\rcbot\dlls\rcbot_mm.dll) and a second copy exists inside the mod at
REM ts\addons\rcbot, so both are deployed -- two disagreeing copies is the kind
REM of drift this whole script exists to prevent.

REM ---- register the plugins with AMXX --------------------------------------
REM Deploying the .amxx is NOT enough. AMXX only loads what plugins.ini lists, so a
REM freshly built plugin sits in the plugins folder doing nothing and its chat
REM command produces no response whatsoever -- not an error, not a refusal, just
REM silence, which reads exactly like a broken command.
REM
REM One more trap: the append below lands on the file's last line, and if that
REM line has no newline after it the two names fuse into one nonexistent file --
REM which silently kills BOTH plugins, the listed one and the new one. So a bare
REM newline goes in first; the blank line it can leave behind is harmless.

REM ---- the Half-Life folder, not the mod folder ----------------------------

REM tool and the Discord bot do NOT live there: ts.bat sits beside hlds.exe
REM because that is what it runs, restore_originals.bat sits beside vgui.dll
REM and the ts\ folder (its zips live in ts\), and discord-bot\ sits beside ts\
REM because the bot finds the plugin's config at ..\ts\addons\amxmodx\configs.

REM ---- the official preset's hashes (docs\H9_PRESENCE.txt, 4d) -------------
REM The SHA-256 of every plugin, module and Metamod plugin an authenticated server may run is the
REM site's allowlist, and an update that changes one without the allowlist leaves every server that
REM takes it reading as modified. So the files an admin imports, H9XASH\presets\official-preset.json and one
REM official-preset-<Mode>.json for each game mode,
REM is rewritten here from what this build just put into H9XASH, before export.bat carries it to the
REM git copy. The GitHub workflow preset-hash.yml fails a change that does not carry it.
