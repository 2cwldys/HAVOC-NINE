/**
 * What a map spec of The Specialists is built with where the spec says nothing (src/spec/map.mjs, `smak build
 * --mod`; docs/SPEC-MAPS.md, "A mod's map"): the game's textures, its props as its maps put them, and rooms furnished
 * by their `use` with the game's own models. Read off the 29 maps on 2026-10-21:
 *
 *   textures  The maps keep most of their textures inside themselves or in .wad files the game does not ship
 *             (2105 of the 2381 they wear); a map of one's own can name only the shipped ones: ts/specialists.wad
 *             (116) and valve/halflife.wad. Each word below is the one of those two the maps wear most for that
 *             part (by the area of floor, wall or ceiling, and the maps that wear it): wood4a the floor (4 maps,
 *             the most of any shipped texture), crete33 the walls (the most wall), fifties_ceil01 the ceiling
 *             (3 maps, the most ceiling), door006 a door (2), basetrim02 the trim (2), wall1 brick outside,
 *             masphalt4 a roof and a yard (2); a room's use wears cardbox1 crates (3), metal_rusty5ccc barrels
 *             (2), lab1_cab2 lockers, drkmtlt_bord11 consoles, +0drkmtl_scrn screens, trrm_wood2 desks, lab1_b4
 *             machines (2 each), lab1_brd10 pipes (4), lab1_trim3 struts (3). More named, for a room's
 *             `surfaces`: ts_tile, ts_brick, ts_concrete, ts_plaster, ts_parquet, ts_planks, ts_asphalt,
 *             ts_street, ts_metal, ts_hazard, ts_glass.
 *   props     a ts_model (627 in 14 maps; cycler_sprite 71 in 2, env_sprite 49 in 1): its `model`, `angles`.
 *   things    only models the maps name (so the game has them; a model it has not stops a map loading), each
 *             measured with this kit's reader posed in its first animation: `r` half its length along a wall,
 *             `wall` its origin off the wall, `deep` how far it reaches into the room, `lift` its origin over its
 *             foot (the game's potted plants stand on their middle), `turn` the yaw that faces it +x, its back
 *             to -x, read from where the maps stand it (the nearest wall behind it: a couch's back is +y, 33 of
 *             43 against a wall so) and from its pictures; a computer stands `on` a desk of the kit's (the maps
 *             stand theirs on brush desks). `high` its top over its foot, measured so. The counts: [placed, in
 *             maps].
 *   solid     the game's program makes a ts_model a point to a player: ts_i386.so's CTSModel::Spawn sets its size to
 *             nothing (UTIL_SetSize with two zero vectors), its solid to SOLID_SLIDEBOX and its movetype to none, so
 *             a player walks through a couch and stops only at its origin, and a shot passes it. The maps' makers
 *             put CLIP brushes round some (measured: the player's hull solid at a ts_model's origin where the
 *             point hull is open all round it): 118 of 886, the seating most (3dm_sofa_antro 18 of 18,
 *             lmd_dualbooth 16 of 18, Schmung/sg_couch 8 of 17, 3dm_chair 27 of 69), plants, boxes and benches
 *             none. The profile clips what a player would walk into and not through: couches, armchairs,
 *             tables, booths, boxes, a dumpster, a bench, a statue (`solid: true`); plants, pictures, office
 *             chairs and the street lamp are walked through, as in the game's maps.
 *   uses      office, lobby, cafe, warehouse, garage, server, stairwell, and in the open (`sky`) alley, plaza and
 *             rooftop; the game has no models for a bathroom or a kitchen's stove, and its crates are brushes
 *             (func_breakable, 1006 in 27 maps): a warehouse's crates are the kit's in cardbox1 beside the
 *             game's boxes.
 *   lamps     the game's light textures, lit as texture lights (an info_texlights in the map: hlrad's own list, no
 *             lights.rad needed). The game ships no lights.rad and specialists.wad has no light texture: its maps'
 *             lamps are halflife.wad's, +0~fifties_lgt2 the most (12 maps), then ~trn_lt1 (9), +0~generic86 and
 *             +0~light3a (6), ~light3b and +0~generic85 (4)... Each colour is the one the maps' makers lit it in:
 *             the median of the light on its own faces in those maps (an emitter's face is lit by its own value,
 *             99 to 100 in 100 of their luxels at full: fifties_lgt2 252 255 234, warm where Valve's list has it
 *             cool). +0~white (7 maps) is no emitter (6 in 100 at full) and is left out. Each brightness is the
 *             one this kit's Valve list was calibrated to (src/maps/texlights.mjs: a recompile of Valve's maps lit
 *             as the retail ones), for want of the makers' own: a lamp of the same texture and size. The fixture
 *             every room's lamp is built as (`fixture`) is +0~fifties_lgt2, a tube of 16 by 64 on the ceiling;
 *             ts_lamp, ts_lamp_warm, ts_lamp_cool, ts_sodium and ts_screen name the rest for a spec's own.
 *   breakable what breaks (func_breakable: 1006 in 27 of the 29 maps, read 2026-10-21 from their entities). Glass
 *             is the most: most leave `material` out (its default is 0, glass: 533) and draw it in render mode 2
 *             (522), `renderamt` 75 to 150 (100 the middle), `health` 1 (222 of the glass, 68 more at 3).
 *             Crates are wood (`material` 1, 242 of all): cardbox1, cardboxtop/bot, the maps' own boxes, 32 to 48
 *             a side, `health` 25, 15, 2 or 1 (15 the middle); seven of them stand on another. Metal (`material`
 *             2, 61) is vents and grates at `health` 1, doors and crates at 50 to 100; concrete (4, 129) 25 to 60.
 *             No map of the game's sets `respawntime` (0: the game's 30 seconds, per ts/mapping.txt; under 0:
 *             never); a round of the Havoc9 matchmode plugin resets nothing, so a map of its takes 45
 *             (maps/meridian/STUDY.md: 30 to 60, never under 0). The kit's crates are wood that breaks, each
 *             crate alone, as the game's do (`pieces`); a window's glass is the game's glass_bright, which its
 *             maps break most of the shipped glass (27).
