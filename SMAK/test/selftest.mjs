// A model is made from nothing, then read, changed in every way the kit can change one, checked and drawn.
// Run it first on a new machine: if it passes, Node is new enough and the kit is whole.

// The cases are in one file an area, beside this one, and run in the order below. That order matters: the
// first case builds the knife model that the others start from, and a few later cases use what an earlier
// one found. What they share (the temp folder, `test`, `sure`, the knife) is in helper.mjs; the two
// fixture-*.mjs files hold the small models that more than one area uses.
