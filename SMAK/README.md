# SMAK: Studio Model Agent Kit

A toolkit an AI coding agent (Claude Code, or any agent that runs commands and looks at pictures) uses to make
content for **GoldSrc games**, Half-Life and its mods: models, animations, textures and maps. The agent writes
short scripts with it, draws what it made to check its own work, and plays the result in the game. Since 0.29 it
also takes them to **Source**: a GoldSrc model ported to Garry's Mod, with physics and a ragdoll, and since 0.30 a
GoldSrc map, held to the original in the running game. Since 0.31 a GoldSrc model goes to **s&box** (Source 2) too.

model, map and shot in it was made by an agent with SMAK.

## What it has made

![A monster from nothing, a walled town from a script, the town's defence in the game, and a team arena for The Specialists](docs/media/showcase.jpg)

- **Moria**, for Master Sword Classic: a walled town with an orchard, a hall to walk into, cellars, a four-round
  defence with militia and archers, and a boss who falls, rises and falls again. Written as a script, compiled,
  walk-tested, and played in the game by the agent before anyone else.
- **Monsters and props**: a scarecrow made from nothing (bones, body, paint and walk), game monsters re-skinned by
  rules, apple trees, weapons from the kits, a rigid robot on a soldier's skeleton.
- **The Specialists**: a team arena with bot waypoints and a role-play city.

### In Garry's Mod

![A barrel built by the kit rolling on gm_construct, and Half-Life's grunt ported as a ragdoll held by the gravity gun](docs/media/gmod.jpg)

- **A barrel built from a spec** and **Half-Life's grunt, ported**, each by a Sonnet worker, compiled by GMod's own
  studiomdl and held to the original corner by corner. The barrel collides as its convex hull and weighs as wood;
  the grunt falls as a ragdoll of 22 pieces. `smak gmod-port model.mdl -o out` ([docs/SOURCE.md](docs/SOURCE.md)).
- All 210 of Half-Life's models port and compile whole.
- **Half-Life's maps**, rewritten as Source maps from stevenlafl's converter: their geometry, light and visibility
  kept, their collision rebuilt, their physics made by GMod's own. All 115 port. In the running game the kit puts
  a probe that answers PASS or FAIL, and holds each map's collision to the original's: eight of them agree on all
  but 0.02 to 0.34 in a hundred spots. `smak gmod-map map.bsp -o out`, `gmod-probe map`, `gmod-collision`.

### In s&box

- **Half-Life's models, ported to s&box** (Source 2): meshes and animations as DMX, bodygroups, skins, hit boxes,
  attachments, root motion and events in a `.vmdl`, compiled by s&box's own resourcecompiler. All 210 compile,
  and all 210 read back in its editor pose as GoldSrc's, bone by bone (`smak sbox-check`). `smak sbox-port
  model.mdl -o MyProject/Assets` ([docs/SBOX.md](docs/SBOX.md)).
- **And they collide**: a prop as its hull, a figure as a ragdoll of s&box's own joints, its pieces' weights and
  surfaces as the GMod port's. All 210 pass in s&box's physics: held at rest and in their animations' poses, and
  dropped onto a floor until still, nothing through it.
- **And they aim**: an animation's blends (Half-Life's aiming up and down) in an animation graph, chosen and blended
  by the game's code as GoldSrc's was (`sequence`, `blend_xr`); s&box's blend held to GoldSrc's at every bone.
- **And they sound**: the sounds their events play as `.sound` assets, heard as far as GoldSrc heard them, their
  loops kept, played by s&box with no game code. Half-Life's 13 models with sounds pass: every sound as loud as its
  original, every event heard.
- **And a map**: a GoldSrc map as an s&box scene, its faces the scene editor's own meshes (drawn, solid, editable),
  its clip brushes, textures, sky, starts, lights and their bounce (s&box's own indirect light). Held in the editor
  to the original: Half-Life's stalkyard blocks a player where GoldSrc does at all but 0.16 in a hundred spots, and
  pictured from its 21 starts it is as bright as GoldSrc draws it with its lightmaps. `smak sbox-map map.bsp -o MyProject/Assets`, `sbox-map-check`.

## How it works

1. You say what you want: "a darker, more worn katana", "a walled town with an orchard", "a new monster".
2. The agent reads `AGENTS.md`, writes a short script with the kit, and runs it.
3. SMAK builds the model or map, checks it against the engine's limits and the game's own rules, and draws it.
4. The agent looks at the pictures, fixes what is wrong, and plays it in the game when a browser build is there.

It reads and writes the game's files directly: no decompiler, no studiomdl, no Blender, nothing to install. For
Source, it writes what Valve's compiler reads and runs the one that comes with Garry's Mod.

## Start

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18 or later.
2. Check the kit: `node test/selftest.mjs` ends with `0 failed`.
3. Start your agent inside the `smak` folder, or tell it: *"Read `smak/AGENTS.md`. My mod's models are in
   `C:\…\mymod\models`."* Then ask for something small first, such as a texture change.

```
node bin/smak.mjs info   model.mdl                 what is in a model
node bin/smak.mjs sheet  model.mdl -o sheet.png    six views of it
node bin/smak.mjs check  model.mdl                 would the engine load it
node bin/smak.mjs map-plan map.bsp -o plan.png     a map from above, every entity marked
node bin/smak.mjs map-reach map.bsp -o walk.png    the walk test: what a player can reach
node bin/smak.mjs view   a/folder/of/models         two models side by side, in the browser
node bin/smak.mjs help                              every command
```

## Limits

- Made for GoldSrc (model version 10, map version 30). Source: a GoldSrc model or map ported to Garry's Mod, and
  Source models read and drawn; new models made for Source in part. A map's outputs, water surfaces, animated
  textures and decals are not ported yet.
- One bone a vertex, as the format has it. Animations kept in `name01.mdl` files are read, not edited.
- The kit's pictures use a plain light of their own: shape, size, texture and pose are true, brightness is not.
- It does not ship any game's content. A game's models and textures belong to its authors.

## Licence

MIT (see `LICENSE`) for the kit's code. What you make from a game's files is that game's authors' to allow.
SMAK began as the tooling of the msr-web project (Master Sword Classic in the browser).
