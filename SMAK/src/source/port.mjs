// A GoldSrc model (.mdl, version 10) made the files Source's compiler builds a model from: SMD for each
// submodel and each animation, a QC that says how they go together, and a VTF and a VMT for each texture.
// Nothing is decompiled by another program: the model is read by this kit (mdl.mjs) and written out as text.
//
//   portToSource(src, { name, folder, groups, collision })   -> { name, modelname, files, warnings, facts }
//   writePort(port, out)                                       the files written under `out`
//
// WHAT GOES WHERE (under `out`):
//   src/<name>.qc, src/<submodel>.smd, src/anims/<animation>.smd    what the compiler reads (compile.mjs runs it)
//   addon/materials/models/<folder>/<name>/<texture>.vtf and .vmt   the textures, as GMod looks for them
//   addon/models/<folder>/<name>.mdl ...                             the compiled model, once compiled
// `addon` is a folder the person puts in garrysmod/addons/ as it is.
//
// WHAT IS KEPT AS IT WAS:
// - the bones, their names and their rest, and every animation's frames, value for value: a GoldSrc bone's six
//   values are an SMD bone's six;
// - each bodypart as a $bodygroup, each submodel in it in its order (one with no triangles `blank`), so a body
//   number means what it meant;
// - each skin family as a row of the $texturegroup, so a skin number means what it meant;
// - the attachments, the hit boxes and their groups, the eyes and the boxes;
// - an animation's fps, looping, activity and weight, and its events by their numbers;
// - a looping animation's travel. GoldSrc's compiler took it out of the frames of a sequence marked LX (LY, LZ)
//   and kept it as its linearmovement: it is put back into the root bones' frames, and Source's compiler, told LX
//   in its turn and with no rollback ($motionrollback 0), takes it out again in the same straight line. A one-shot
//   stays in place, as GoldSrc played it: Source takes a one-shot's travel out along a curve (a jump straight
//   ahead lurched back), stevenlafl's finding in The Specialists' port;
// - an animation's blends (Half-Life's aiming up and down), each axis on a pose parameter named by the motion it
//   was (blend_xr, a pitch; blend where it names none), over the values GoldSrc gave its first and last blend;
// - the sound an event plays (1004, 1008, 5004: a step, a voice, a gun's clip) moved under the port's folder,
//   sound/<folder>/<its path>, clear of GMod's own sounds of that name (Half-Life 2's weapons/ and common/);
//   `sounds` lists them, for portToGmod to copy from the game. A view model's (5004, its clip) are not left
//   in the model: GMod never plays a view model's own sound events (stevenlafl's finding, porting The
//   Specialists, whose reloads were silent). They are written as Lua beside it instead
//   (addon/lua/autorun/client/, viewSoundsLua), which plays each as the view model's animation passes its
//   frame, for the holder alone, as GoldSrc's client did;
// - a view model's animations start outright (fadein 0 fadeout 0), as GoldSrc's did: Source fades a new one in
//   over 0.2 s, which swallows a gun's short kick. Those with no activity are given Source's by their names
//   (VIEW_ACTIVITIES: idle ACT_VM_IDLE, shoot ACT_VM_PRIMARYATTACK...), which a GMod weapon's script plays them by;
//   its first attachment, unnamed, is its `muzzle`, turned along the gun's forward in its first animation (a
//   Source attachment points along its x, where GMod's muzzle flash goes; GoldSrc's have no turn);
// - a player, and a weapon held in a player's hand (a p_ model), made a biped GMod knows (biped.mjs): Valve's bone
//   names, the hands turned as Valve's are. A player also gets the bones and attachments GMod looks for on its
//   hands, and stands on its feet: GoldSrc's player stands about its middle, 36 above its feet (PLAYER_LIFT), and
//   Source's on its feet, so its animations are lifted and it is lit from its middle ($illumposition). With
//   `upper`, each animation has a copy that moves the body from the spine up (<name>_upper), for laying over a
//   walk.
//
// WHAT CHANGES, AND WHY:
// - the meshes are written in the model's space (GoldSrc keeps them in their bone's), the corners of each
//   triangle the other way round (SMD wants them counter-clockwise from the front, as GoldSrc's compiler read
//   them; the file keeps them clockwise), and v counted from the picture's bottom;
// - `$origin 0 0 0 -90`: Source's compiler turns everything it reads by 90 degrees about z, as GoldSrc's did
//   when it compiled the original. What is written here is the original as it was compiled, already turned;
// - a texture is a picture of a power of two each way (resampled up: GoldSrc's may be 96 by 83), mip-mapped;
// - a texture's flags become its material's: masked (64) alpha-tested with its last colour a hole, additive
//   (32) additive, fullbright (4) UnlitGeneric. Chrome (2) has no like in Source: GoldSrc never draws a chrome
//   texture by the file's s and t, but by how each corner's surface faces the eye, worked out again each frame
//   (R_StudioChrome). It is worked out once, in the first animation's first frame, from where the eye is: for a
//   view model where it always is (the model's origin, looking along x), for anything else in front of it.
//
// WHAT IS LEFT BEHIND, each said in a warning: bone controllers (Source turns a head by pose parameters), an
// animation's blends after its first (Source blends by pose parameters), an activity whose name this kit does not
// know, an animation kept in a file that is not given, the blends of an animation of more than two that are not
// two axes of two.
