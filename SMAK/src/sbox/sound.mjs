// MEASURED (2026-10-26, s&box's resourcecompiler and editor, Half-Life's sounds):
// - the .wav is kept as it is. The compiler takes GoldSrc's 8-bit files at 11025, 22050 and 44100 Hz and 16-bit
//   stereo ones, and writes them as Opus at 48000 Hz, of the same length; a small one (common/npc_step3.wav, 2217
//   samples) as 16-bit PCM at its own rate. Read back, their loudness 10 ms by 10 ms is the original's (correlated
//   0.9995 or more). Its compiled form is <name>.vsnd_c, the .sound names <name>.vsnd;
// - a loop (GoldSrc loops a file from its cue point to its end) is not read from the file's cue chunk by the
//   compiler: it is told in the .meta beside the file ({ loop, start }: the cue's time in seconds; no end, which is
//   the file's). weapons/rocket1.wav, its cue at 23395 of 54997, loops from 50927 of 119722 at 48000, and still plays
//   3 seconds after it started (it is 2.49 long);
// - the .sound is compiled by the editor, not by resourcecompiler ("Failed to find compiler").
//
// AS GOLDSRC'S MIXER PLAYED IT (Xash3D's S_SpatializeChannel, Quake's): a sound's gain falls in a straight line
// from 1 where it is to 0 at 1000 units over its attenuation (ATTN_NORM 0.8: 1250, ATTN_IDLE 2: 500), heard
// nowhere farther. s&box's mixer gains a sound by its Falloff curve at its distance over its Distance, so the
// .sound's Distance is 1000 / attenuation and its Falloff a line from 1 to 0 (its points Linear: read back, 0.75 at
// a quarter of the way, 0.5 half way). No occlusion, reverb or air absorption: GoldSrc's mixer had none of them.
