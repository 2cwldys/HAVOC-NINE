// A GoldSrc map drawn in s&box with the light its compiler baked: every face's lightmap packed into one picture of
// the map's (an atlas), and a shader of SMAK's own that lays it on the texture as GoldSrc does. The map's light is
// then the game's own, room by room, bounces and all, with no light of s&box's to bake (the GMod port keeps
// GoldSrc's lightmaps the same way, converted).
//
//   lightmapAtlas(bsp, faces, patterns) -> { width, height, rgba, offsetOf(face), styles }: the faces' light in one
//                                          picture, and the patterns of the styles that change
//   LIGHTMAP_SHADER, lightmapShader()   the shader's path in a project, and its text
//
// WHERE A FACE'S LIGHT IS. A PolygonMesh has one set of texture coordinates, the texture's. The face's place in the
// atlas rides in its corners' vertex colour instead, the same at every corner: two numbers of 16 bits (red and
// green, blue and alpha), the atlas pixel of its first sample less the sample's place on the texture's grid (its
// texture pixel / 16), plus OFFSET_BIAS. The shader finds a point's sample from its texture pixel (its texture
// coordinates times the texture's size, g_vTextureSize) / 16 plus that, half a pixel on to the sample's middle, and
// reads the atlas between samples (bilinear), as GoldSrc mixes them. Each face's samples have a border of their own
// edge's copied round them, so no face's light runs into another's.
//
// THE LIGHT AS GOLDSRC LAYS IT (draw.mjs BRIGHTNESS): the screen's colour is the texture's times sample / 255
// times 1.55, cut off at white, both as the screen shows them. s&box adds up light in linear light: the same
// colour is worked out on the screen's colours (the sRGB curve undone and done again round it). Drawn as emission, on no
// albedo: s&box's own lights add only their gloss.
//
// ITS STYLES. A face has up to four lightmaps, one a style (light.mjs), each style a pattern of letters the game
// plays at ten a second ("m" the light as baked: stylePatterns). A style whose pattern is one letter is steady: its
// light is added into the atlas at its letter's share ("a" none, "m" all). A style whose pattern changes (a flicker,
// a strobe) is kept apart, in a layer of the atlas below the first, at the same place as its face's patch, one layer
// for each such style a face has; the layer's alpha is the style's row in a second picture, `styles` (one row a
// style: its letters in red, (letter - "a") x 10, its length in green), which the shader plays by its clock
// (g_flTime), as the game plays them. A light switched by a name stays as the map starts it: no stock TS map
// switches one, and a switch needs code of the game's.
//
// ITS DYNAMIC LIGHTS (the engine's dlights: a flashlight, a muzzle's flash), as GoldSrc adds them to a face's lightmap
// (R_AddDynamicLights): a light reaches a face its radius off its plane, on either side (rad = radius - |distance|);
// at each of the face's samples, 16 texels apart, it adds (rad - d) x its colour, d the distance in the face's texture
// plane from the point under the light, as the engine measures it (the longer of the two axes' plus half the shorter,
// in whole texels), where d is under rad less its minlight. That is on the lightmap's own scale (a sample x its
// style's value, 264 for "m"): so here light += (rad - d) x colour / 264, at the samples and mixed between them as the
// atlas is, before the light's scale. The face's texture grid is found where the point is, from how its world place
// and its texels change across the screen. The game hands them to every material of the scene (Scene.RenderAttributes):
// SmakDlight0..7 (its place, its radius; 0 for none) and SmakDlightColor0.. (its colour, 0..1, and its
// minlight). Not on a face drawn at full light (a liquid's, the sky's), as in the game.
//
// ITS TEXTURE'S ANIMATION, SCROLL AND ENTITY (Xash3D gl_rsurf.c R_TextureAnimation, DrawGLPoly; the SDK's
// CFuncConveyor::UpdateSpeed): an animated texture's frames side by side in one picture (its own set, +0..+9 or
// +a..+j, then the other), g_flFrames and g_flOtherFrames of them, each g_vFrameShare of the picture; the frame of
// the moment at ANIMATION_RATE a second (Xash's rate for a texture not of Quake's palette), from its own set, or the
// other while its entity's frame is on (a button pressed). A conveyor's texture (scroll*) moves along s by
// g_flScroll of its width a second. A face whose entity's state the game changes names its slot (g_flSlot, the brush
// model's number) in a picture the game hands every material (SmakEntities, with SmakEntitiesSet 1 once it does):
// an 8-bit texel each: red full while the entity's frame is on, green full while its conveyor runs the other way, blue
// its render amount (of 255) with alpha full, else (alpha 0) the map's amount. F_TRANSLUCENT 2 adds a face (kRenderTransAdd), unlit: the texture times its amount.
