// A GoldSrc map (BSP 30) made an s&box scene: its compiled faces as the scene editor's own meshes, which s&box

//   scenes/<folder>/<map>.scene                          the map: one game object for the world, one for each brush
//                                                        entity, one for each spawn point and light, the sky's
//   materials/<folder>/<wad>/<texture>.png .vmat         a wad's textures, shared by the maps that wear them (a
//                                                        holed one's holes in <texture>_mask.png)
//   materials/<folder>/maps/<map>/<texture>.png .vmat    a texture the map carries inside itself
//   materials/<folder>/sky/<skyname>.png .vmat           its sky, the six sides made one picture round the world
//   materials/<folder>/maps/<map>/lighttree.bin          with lightmaps: what a game lights models by as GoldSrc does
//                                                        (maps/model-light.mjs lightTreeBytes)
//
// THE FACES. Each face of the BSP is a polygon of a MeshComponent's PolygonMesh, as compiled (split by the
// compiler where the tree cut it): the world's in one, each brush entity's (`model` "*N") in its own, at its
// `origin`. A PolygonMesh is saved as a blob (PolygonMesh.Serialize.cs, MeshBlob): a half-edge mesh, every side of
// a polygon an edge inside it and its twin outside, and per half-edge the texture coordinate of the corner it
// points to. Each face here is a polygon of its own, its corners shared with no other, so no edge is ever shared
// by three faces, which a BSP's T-junctions and touching brushes would make (measured: stalkyard's 2502 faces all
// taken, none bad). GoldSrc walks a face clockwise seen from the front, s&box anticlockwise: the corners are
// turned round. A corner's coordinate is GoldSrc's (a point's dot with the texture's axes, over its size): units
// and axes are the same in both, inches and Z up.
//
// WHAT IS NOT DRAWN: sky faces (the sky is SkyBox2D's) and the compilers' tool textures (clip, origin, null, hint,
// skip, aaatrigger), so a trigger or a ladder (all aaatrigger) has no mesh yet. func_illusionary is drawn and
// collides with nothing.
//
// THE LIGHTS are s&box's, made from GoldSrc's light entities: GoldSrc's own light is baked in the map's lightmaps,
// which a PolygonMesh has no place for. `light` a PointLight, `light_spot` a SpotLight (`_cone`, `_cone2` its
// inner and outer half angles), `light_environment` a DirectionalLight, its colour also the sky's light
// (SkyColor). A light's colour is GoldSrc's `_light` in linear light times brightness / 255 (lightOf, as the GMod
// port's WORLDLIGHTS), and it reaches LIGHT_REACH units per the root of its brightness. A face whose texture
// shines (Valve's maps' lights.rad, texlights.mjs, or the map's own info_texlights) is drawn lit by itself and has a
// SpotLight before it, as strong as hlrad made it (TEXLIGHT_SCALE). The sun is SUN_SCALE times its colour, the sky's light SKY_LIGHT_SHARE
// of it: GoldSrc's light compiler bounced the light and spread the sky's, which s&box's lights do not, and these
// were fitted so that stalkyard's 21 starts look as bright as GoldSrc draws them with its lightmaps (mapcheck.mjs).
