// This file is no part of the kit's core, and nothing in `src/` knows of it. It is here to be copied: a
// profile for another GoldSrc mod is written the same way, from that mod's FGD, its own maps and what its
// code is known to do (docs/MAPS-MAKING.md, "A mod's profile"). It holds no game content: the definitions
// are read from the installed game when the profile is made (the game's FGDs, its hundred maps, its script
// pack), so it needs the game.
